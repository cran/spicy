# spicy 0.13.0

`table_regression()` now covers more than thirty model classes and gains
a univariable screen, the summary tables get survey-design twins, six
journal styles and a French output arrive, and declared missing values
are honored package-wide. The walk-throughs live as articles at
<https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/>.

## Breaking changes

* Declared missing values (`na_values`, `na_range`, tagged NAs) now count
  as missing in `freq()`, `cross_tab()`, the `table_*()` family, the
  row-wise helpers, and `varlist()` / `code_book()`, so numbers change
  for labelled survey data. The tables disclose the exclusion in a note.
  `user_na = FALSE` restores the previous behavior.

* `varlist()`, `vl()`, and `code_book()` use one missing definition for
  `N_distinct`, `N_valid`, and `NAs` on labelled data.

* `cross_tab()` counts observations at an explicit `NA` factor level as a
  regular row or column. `freq()` excludes them from `n_valid` and the
  valid percent.

* `freq()` and `cross_tab()` replace `styled` with `output`.
  `styled = FALSE` becomes `output = "data.frame"`, and `styled` now
  errors with the replacement.

* `cross_tab(output = "data.frame")` returns a plain `data.frame` without
  metadata attributes. Read them from the default object, for example
  `attr(cross_tab(...), "p_value")`.

* `freq()` defaults to `rescale = FALSE`, matching `cross_tab()`. Use
  `rescale = TRUE` for the previous behavior.

* `freq()`, `table_categorical()`, `table_continuous()`, and
  `table_continuous_lm()` no longer print when their result is assigned.
  `freq()` drops its unused `...`, so unknown arguments error.

* `options(OutDec)` no longer changes spicy's output. Every number
  follows `decimal_mark` alone, or the style or language in force.

* `table_categorical()` defaults to `drop_na = FALSE`, showing missing
  values as a `"(Missing)"` level. Its `labels` must be a named vector,
  and `p_digits` below 1 errors.

* `table_categorical(output = "long")` names the association column
  `effect_size` and adds `effect_size_type`. Replace
  `out[["Cramer's V"]]` with `out$effect_size`.

* `table_categorical(output = "flextable")` no longer writes a `.docx`
  when `word_path` is supplied. Use `flextable::save_as_docx()`.

* `table_continuous_lm(output = "data.frame")` names the effect-size
  interval bounds `es_ci_lower` / `es_ci_upper`, like the `"long"`
  output.

* `standardized = "smart"` scales continuous inputs by 2 SD and leaves
  binary inputs unscaled. The rule was applied inverted since 0.12.0,
  so those betas change.

* `table_regression(exponentiate = TRUE)` errors on links whose
  exponentiated coefficient is not a ratio (probit, cauchit, inverse,
  sqrt).

* `keep` / `drop` no longer match the intercept row. `show_intercept`
  alone controls it.

* `align = "auto"` is removed. Use `"decimal"` (the default),
  `"center"`, or `"right"`.

* The `show_fit_stats` information criteria are lowercase tokens
  (`"aic"`, `"aicc"`, `"bic"`). `show_fit_stats = character(0)` errors.
  Use `FALSE` to suppress the block.

* With several models, `show_columns = "all_b"` / `"all_ame"` drop the
  CI columns. Request atomic tokens to keep them.

* A robust `vcov` that cannot be computed is now an error, and a
  `cluster` containing `NA` is refused. It used to warn and label the
  classical variance robust.

* `Weighted n` and `glance()`'s `weighted_nobs` are `NA` for an
  unweighted `glm()`. They used to repeat `n`.

* `as_structured()` describes each row in the body itself
  (`body$.row_role`, `body$.indent`, `cell_status`). The 0.12.0
  row-index vectors are removed, `version` is `3`, and a view built by
  an older spicy is refused.

* `tidy()` labels AME rows `estimate_type = "ame"` (was `"AME"`).

* `count_n()` warns and returns `NA` when the selection resolves to no
  usable column. `mean_n()` and `sum_n()` with `min_valid = 0` return
  `NA` for rows with no valid values.

* `copy_clipboard()` arguments use snake_case. `build_ascii_table()` is
  no longer exported. Use `spicy_print_table()`.

* Association measures with `detail = TRUE` always include an `se`
  element. On degenerate tables, `gamma_gk()`, `kendall_tau_b()`,
  `kendall_tau_c()`, and `uncertainty_coef()` return `NA` with a classed
  warning instead of a spurious value. `conf_level` is validated
  everywhere.

* The package ships a single vignette, *Get started*. The walk-throughs
  live as articles on the package site, at the same URLs, and
  `vignette("<name>")` no longer finds them.

## New features

* `table_regression()` supports more than thirty model classes beyond
  `lm` / `glm`: mixed effects (`lmer`, `glmer`, `glmmTMB`, `lme`, `gls`),
  GEE, Bayesian (`stan_glm()`, `stan_glmer()`, `brm()`), survival
  (`coxph`, `survreg`, `cph`, `flexsurvreg`), ordinal (`polr`, `clm`),
  multinomial (`multinom`, `mlogit`), two-part counts (`zeroinfl`,
  `hurdle`), `fixest`, `estimatr`, `ivreg`, `tobit`, `rq`, `rlm`,
  `glm.nb`, `nls`, `gam`, `betareg`, `selection`, `rms`, and the
  design-based `svyglm`, `svyolr`, and `svycoxph`.
  `?table_regression_models` is the registry. A request a class cannot
  honor is refused with a classed error, never rendered as an empty
  column.

* Each family renders with its own conventions. Mixed models report
  their random effects as a block of rows with SE and CI, the ICC, and a
  boundary-correct test of the random part. Ordinal models report their
  thresholds. Two-part models report every component. `fixest` and
  `estimatr` fits disclose their absorbed fixed effects as a
  `Fixed effects:` block. Bayesian fits report posterior medians, MAD
  SD, and credible intervals, with no p-values and a sampler-diagnostics
  guard.

* New `table_continuous_svy()` and `table_categorical_svy()` summarize a
  `survey` design object, with every statistic computed by survey and
  the design degrees of freedom throughout. Design-based regressions
  (`svyglm()`, `svyolr()`, `svycoxph()`) report both counts and name
  their variance estimator in the note.

* New `table_outcome()` summarizes one continuous outcome across several
  categorical variables, one block per grouping, with the group
  comparison and an `Overall` row.

* New `table_regression_uv()` builds univariable screening tables for
  `lm`, `glm`, and `coxph` outcomes, one fit per predictor merged beside
  the multivariable model, with a per-predictor `N` column.

* New `inline()` cites one table cell in Quarto or R Markdown text. The
  returned string is exactly the displayed cell, so a quoted number can
  never drift from the table.

* New `style` argument on the four table families, and
  `options(spicy.style = )` for a whole document: `"jama"`, `"nejm"`,
  `"lancet"`, `"annals"`, `"apa"`, and `"aer"`. A theme applies the
  rules its journal publishes, as defaults, so any argument you pass
  wins. `spicy_style()` builds a style by hand or from a theme.

* `options(spicy.language = "fr")` prints table labels in French and
  brings French typography with it: a decimal comma and a leading zero
  on p-values (`0,003`). Machine outputs, column names, and messages
  stay in English. `options(spicy.labels = )` overrides one label at a
  time, and `spicy_labels()` lists them.

* New `show_columns` families `"rmst"` and `"risk_diff"` for `coxph` and
  `survreg` fits: covariate-adjusted differences in restricted mean
  survival time and in cumulative incidence, by g-computation with
  bootstrap inference, in single tables and in the univariable screen.

* New `show_columns` token `"n_events"` shows event counts as `events/N`
  beside the estimates, for binomial outcomes and `coxph` fits.

* Heteroskedasticity- and cluster-robust `vcov` across the supported
  classes, with each class's field-standard backend. `"CR1S"`
  reproduces Stata's `regress, vce(cluster)` exactly. What no backend
  supports is refused, never approximated.

* `ci_method = "profile"` gives profile-likelihood CIs for `glm`,
  `polr`, and `clm`. `ci_method = "boot_percentile"` reports percentile
  CIs from the bootstrap replicates.

* `nested = TRUE` works across the new classes with the correct test for
  each, and refuses hierarchies that are not comparable.

* AME columns are available for many more classes, per outcome category
  for ordinal and multinomial models, and honor a robust `vcov`.
  `broom::tidy()` gains `outcome_level` for those rows.

* `table_categorical()` and `table_continuous()` gain `smd = TRUE`, a
  standardized-mean-difference column, the balance diagnostic of a
  Table 1.

* `table_continuous()` gains `weights` and `rescale`, under a documented
  convention that matches Stata's `[aweight]` and `survey::svyvar()`.
  Group tests are refused under weights. `table_continuous_lm()` is the
  tool for that.

* `table_continuous()` gains `show_columns` with median tokens (`"med"`,
  `"q1"`, `"q3"`, `"iqr"`, `"med_iqr"`, `"med_ci"`), per variable via a
  named list. A variable shown as a median is tested as one.

* `select` is optional in `table_categorical()`, and `table_continuous()`
  gains `drop_na = FALSE`.

* `as_structured()` reads the descriptive tables too, and carries
  everything the printed table shows, with a per-row identity
  (`.variable`, `.level`, `.row_role`) that survives stacking.

* Seven new articles on the package site: mixed-effects, GEE,
  multinomial, count and two-part, survival, ordinal regression tables,
  and categorical predictors.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

The first eight fixes change numbers that 0.12.0 reported.

* `kendall_tau_b()` reported wrong standard errors, confidence
  intervals, and p-values in every release from 0.6.0 through 0.12.0.
  Point estimates were correct. `assoc_measures()` and `cross_tab()`
  were affected too.

* Binomial models fitted with a `cbind(successes, failures)` response
  were refitted with squared weights by every internal refit. Bootstrap
  and jackknife inference, the default McFadden and Nagelkerke R², and
  `standardized = "refit"` were wrong for them. Fits with a 0/1, factor,
  or proportion-plus-weights response were never affected.

* Average marginal effects use the fit's prior weights, so AME values
  change for weighted fits.

* Partial effect sizes are true Type-II tests. In models with
  interactions, main effects no longer depend on the factor coding.

* `ci_method = "profile"` with a robust `vcov` defers to the `vcov` and
  warns.

* `table_categorical()` computes the ordinal association measures in
  declared level order under `drop_na = FALSE`.

* `table_continuous_lm()` reports correct estimates when `by` is an
  ordered factor and correct `"balanced"` adjusted means with an
  ordered-factor covariate. It pins treatment contrasts, so
  `options(contrasts = )` no longer alters the results.

* `cross_tab()` computes weighted totals from the unrounded table.

* Under `decimal_mark = ","` every surface follows the mark. P-values
  keep their leading zero (`0,018`), and the star legend, the change
  statistics, and the association intervals read the comma.

* `nested = TRUE` no longer reports a negative chi-square with a p-value
  when the models are passed largest-first.

* `cramer_v()`, `phi()`, and `contingency_coef()` return `NA` with a
  classed warning on a zero margin, and
  `somers_d(direction = "symmetric")` returns `0` on equal concordant
  and discordant pairs.

* The `tau_c` measure is labelled `"Stuart's Tau-c"` everywhere.

* `freq()` keeps its label footer when `NA`-weight rows are dropped,
  warns when distinct codes merge under one label, and sorts labelled
  variables by code under `sort = "name+"`.

* `cross_tab()` reports excluded missing values in the table note,
  accepts logical weights like `freq()`, and no longer swallows the
  warnings of its association measures.

* `table_categorical()` displays labelled columns as `"[code] label"`
  levels in every path, and keeps both the group and the margin when a
  `by` level is named `"Total"`. Its machine outputs carry
  full-precision values and the documented `Chi2` and `df` columns.

* `table_categorical()`, `table_continuous()`, and
  `table_continuous_lm()` resolve `by` data-first, like tidyselect. A
  `by` with no level to tabulate is refused.

* `table_continuous()` forms groups from a non-factor `by` in order of
  first appearance, and degrades per variable when a test fails on
  degenerate data.

* `table_continuous()` and `table_continuous_lm()` label an interval
  with its own coverage (`97.5% CI`, not `98% CI`).

* `table_continuous_lm()` discloses robust and resampling SEs in the
  note, treats a value-labelled `by` as categorical, and degrades
  cleanly on degenerate fits.

* `output = "gt"` tables keep their note when saved or printed
  non-interactively. gt and flextable outputs render in Quarto and
  R Markdown Word, PowerPoint, and PDF documents, where they silently
  disappeared. New `as_flextable()` returns the underlying flextable.

* `output = "gt"` escapes a `by` level or model name carrying a quote,
  an angle bracket, or a backslash.

* `stars = TRUE` marks the coefficients in every output, not just the
  console.

* A cell whose statistic applies but has no number shows the console's
  en dash in every rich output, instead of a blank.

* A `table_categorical(by = )` table carries its association note to
  every output. The descriptive gt and tinytable outputs also draw the
  title and the rule between variable blocks.

* Factor levels are indented once, not twice, in the tinytable, Word,
  and Excel outputs.

* Tables without a confidence-interval column lose their empty header
  strip, multi-line notes keep one disclosure per line, and Typst output
  no longer forces a column gutter under grouped headers.

* Footer lines cite a model by its displayed label, not `Model 1`.

* `output = "excel"` writes the significance stars, blank cells instead
  of `#N/A`, honors `align`, and sizes its columns to the text.

* `output = "clipboard"` quotes cells that contain the delimiter, ships
  plain text instead of Excel formulas, and errors clearly on a system
  without a clipboard.

* Console layout survives `NA` cells, empty cells, and wide characters
  (CJK, emoji).

* `table_regression(m1, m2)` without `list()` errors helpfully, and an
  `NA` or colliding model name no longer crashes the table.

* Factor rows follow `levels()` order instead of alphabetical, and
  factors fit with non-default contrasts (successive differences,
  sum-to-zero, Helmert) group under their parent variable.

* A factor level containing `:` (`"Part-time: 50-89%"`) stays inside
  its variable block. It used to be mistaken for an interaction term.

* The statistic column header follows each model's reference
  distribution (`z` or `t`).

* Bootstrap, jackknife, and `standardized = "refit"` refits no longer
  leak the caller's environment and work on `factor()` / `log()` /
  `poly()` formulas.

* `varlist()` and `code_book()` render `POSIXlt` columns and `difftime`
  units, and show an explicit `NA` factor level as `<NA>`.

* `count_n()` resolves `select` and `exclude` through the same
  tidyselect path as `mean_n()` / `sum_n()`, and errors clearly on an
  unusable `count` or `special`.

* The tabulating and summarizing functions reject `bit64::integer64`
  input with a classed error naming the fix.

* Error messages quote values the same way on every platform, and the
  enum arguments raise classed errors naming the valid values.

* `copy_clipboard()` re-emits backend messages and warnings as real R
  conditions.

* An `estimatr` fit reports R² and adjusted R² by default like `lm`,
  discloses its absorbed fixed effects, and labels its model type after
  its `se_type`.

# spicy 0.12.0

## New features

* New `table_regression()`: publication-ready coefficient summary
  for one or more fitted `lm` or `glm` models, side by side. APA
  Manual 7 formatting is the default. Highlights:

  * Robust variance: classical, HC, cluster-robust (CR) with
    Satterthwaite df, bootstrap, jackknife. Per-model `vcov`
    accepted for SE-comparison tables.
  * Standardisation: `refit`, `posthoc`, `basic`, `smart`,
    `pseudo` (the last `glm` only).
  * Average marginal effects (AME) as separate columns; AME
    inference shares the coefficient's variance estimator so B
    and AME are reported on the same inferential footing.
  * Partial effect sizes: f², η², ω² for `lm` (noncentral-F CIs);
    partial χ² for `glm`.
  * GLM response-scale reporting via `exponentiate = TRUE`, with
    family-appropriate labels (OR, IRR, HR, RR, MR, exp(B)) and
    optional profile-likelihood CIs (`ci_method = "profile"`).
  * Multiplicity correction via `p_adjust` (any
    `stats::p.adjust()` method).
  * Hierarchical comparison via `nested = TRUE` (ΔR² / F-change
    for `lm`; LRT for `glm`).
  * Display controls: variable filtering, intercept and factor
    placement, reference-row styles, multi-model labels, stars,
    decimal mark, per-column digits.
  * Outputs: console, `data.frame`, long tibble, `gt`,
    `flextable`, `tinytable`, Excel, Word, clipboard.
    `broom::tidy()` and `broom::glance()` methods supported.

  See `?table_regression` and `vignette("table-regression")`.

* `table_continuous_lm()` gains additive covariate adjustment via
  the new `covariates` argument. Two estimands for the per-group
  adjusted means: `"proportional"` (G-computation, default) and
  `"balanced"` (equal-weight synthetic grid). Under adjustment,
  `f²` and `ω²` become partial effect sizes; `d` and `g` raise an
  explanatory error. The auto-built footer documents the
  covariates and the estimand. See `vignette("table-continuous-lm")`.

* New exported `as_structured()` accessor returns a typed view of
  a `table_regression()` result for programmatic use: raw
  numerics, CI split into `LL` / `UL` columns, and a column-level
  format specification.

## Breaking changes

* `code_book()` no longer silently truncates the export filename
  to 120 characters. Very long titles now surface a clear
  OS-level error. **Migration**: shorten the title or pass an
  explicit `filename =` argument.

## Bug fixes

* `table_categorical()` no longer over-truncates a *p*-value in
  the interval `(10^-p_digits, 0.001)` when `p_digits >= 4`.
  Example: `p = 0.000108` now correctly prints as `".0001"` at
  `p_digits = 4` (was `"<.0001"`).
* `count_n(special = ...)` returns a length-`nrow(data)` zero
  vector when no usable column survives the list-column filter,
  matching the documented contract and the `count = ...` branch
  (was `numeric(0)`, which broke `dplyr::mutate()` pipelines).
* `lambda_gk()` and `goodman_kruskal_tau()` emit
  `spicy_undefined_stat` and return a fully-`NA` result on
  rank-1 contingency tables (constant predicted variable),
  matching the existing pattern in `gamma_gk()`,
  `kendall_tau_b()`, `somers_d()`, and `yule_q()`.
* `cross_tab()` no longer silently overwrites a user's y-variable
  level named `"N"`, `"Total"` or `"Values"`. The conflicting
  reserved column is auto-renamed with a numbered suffix and a
  single `spicy_renamed_column` warning is emitted.
* `broom::glance()` on a `spicy_continuous_lm_table` keeps
  `df.residual` numeric, so Satterthwaite degrees of freedom
  from `vcov = "CR2"` / `"CR3"` are preserved verbatim instead
  of being truncated through `as.integer()`.

## Minor improvements

* Console en-dash alignment: non-numeric placeholders (en-dash,
  "NA") sit at the decimal-mark column instead of the integer-
  part column (APA Manual 7 §7.13). Integer cells in mixed-
  precision columns (`n` row alongside `R²`) keep their right-
  aligned placement.
* `R/` source is byte-pure ASCII (`tools::showNonASCIIfile()`
  reports zero hits package-wide).
* `openxlsx2::wb_add_border()` calls now pass `NULL` on unused
  sides, preventing the default `"thin"` from being applied to
  all four sides of a cell when only one rule is intended.

# spicy 0.11.0

## New features

### `table_continuous_lm()`

* Cluster-robust SEs via `cluster` and four `vcov` choices
  (`"CR0"`–`"CR3"`), dispatched to `clubSandwich` with
  Satterthwaite df (`clubSandwich` in `Suggests`).
* `vcov = "bootstrap"` (nonparametric or cluster) and
  `vcov = "jackknife"` (leave-one-out / leave-one-cluster-out)
  variance estimators in pure base R, controlled by `boot_n`.
* Three new `effect_size` choices alongside `"f2"`: Cohen's
  `"d"`, Hedges' `"g"` (two-group only), Hays' `"omega2"`. New
  `effect_size_ci` adds noncentral *t* / *F* CIs rendered inline
  as `0.18 [0.07, 0.30]`.
* `HC*` estimators delegate to `sandwich::vcovHC()`;
  rank-deficient fits return a clean rank-by-rank covariance.

### Harmonisation across the table family

* Shared reporting vocabulary (`decimal_mark`, `p_digits`,
  `align`, named-`labels`) now spans `cross_tab()`, `freq()` and
  the three `table_*()` helpers, including APA-style p-value
  notation (`<.001` / `.045`, no leading zero).
* `table_categorical()`'s `assoc_measure` accepts a per-variable
  spec. When measures differ across rows the column collapses to
  `"Effect size"` and an APA-style `Note.` line documents the
  per-variable measure; `phi` on a non-2x2 errors.
* All three `table_*()` functions gain `as.data.frame()`,
  `tibble::as_tibble()`, `broom::tidy()` and `broom::glance()`
  methods (`broom` in `Suggests`).

## Quality and robustness

* **Classed conditions.** Errors and warnings now carry stable
  classes (`spicy_error` / `spicy_warning` plus 11 leaf classes
  documented in `?spicy`), so downstream code can dispatch via
  `tryCatch()` / `withCallingHandlers()` instead of matching
  message strings. `rlang (>= 1.1.0)` required.
* **Structured cli messages.** Multi-line errors and warnings
  (vcov fallbacks, bootstrap/jackknife failures, `padding`
  migration, `labels` length mismatch) render as cli bullets.
* **Locale-deterministic ordering.** Sorts in `varlist()`,
  `freq()`, `cross_tab()` and `table_*()` use
  `method = "radix"`. Output is byte-stable across locales and
  platforms, matching Stata / SPSS guarantees.
* **Edge-case hardening.** A new length-guarded sort helper makes
  `varlist()` / `code_book()` / `cross_tab()` / `freq()` survive
  zero-length or all-NA `Date` / `POSIXct` / `character` columns
  and factors with no observed levels.
* **Snapshot-locked rendering.** `tests/testthat/test-snapshots.R`
  pins the exact console output of every spicy print method, so
  any unintended formatting drift surfaces as a PR diff.
* **API stability contract.** `?spicy` documents which exports
  are stable, stabilising or internal. pkgdown reference groups
  exports via four `@family` tags.
* **Cross-software validation.** All 13 association measures
  agree with PSPP 2.0 (`CROSSTABS /STATISTICS=ALL`, 65 / 65
  statistics on four datasets); Cohen's *d* and Hedges' *g*
  noncentral CIs are tested numerically against
  `effectsize::cohens_d()` / `effectsize::hedges_g()`
  (`tolerance = 1e-6`); point-estimate formulas and asymptotic
  standard errors follow `DescTools` (Signorell et al.).

## Improvements

* `cross_tab()` warns when `correct = TRUE` is ignored on a
  non-2x2 sub-table, when `weights` contains `NA`, and notes
  statistics computed on a sub-table after empty rows / columns
  are pruned.
* `cross_tab()` validates `decimal_mark`, `p_digits` and
  `simulate_B` up front; `freq()` validates `decimal_mark` and
  tightens `digits` to a non-negative integer.
* A user category literally named `"N"` or `"Total"` is no longer
  mis-rendered as the totals row in `cross_tab()`.
* `table_continuous_lm(output = "long")` returns `n`, `df1`, `df2`
  as integer columns; `predictor_label` preserved on the
  degenerate-model fallback path.
* `cramer_v()` / `phi()` doc states the CI uses the Fisher
  z-transformation (point estimate and p-value identical to
  `DescTools` / SPSS).
* `uncertainty_coef()` doc states entropy uses `0 log 0 = 0`
  (matching SPSS, PSPP, Stata, Cover & Thomas).

## Bug fixes

* `label_from_names()` raises actionable errors on duplicate or
  empty new column names; trims whitespace and preserves the
  input class.
* `table_continuous_lm(output = "data.frame")` names contrast CI
  columns from `ci_level` (was hardcoded to 95 %).
* The categorical-predictor global Wald *F* degrades to `NA` on
  a singular coefficient covariance submatrix.
* The degenerate-table branch of `cramer_v()`, `yule_q()`,
  `gamma_gk()`, `kendall_tau_b()` and `somers_d()` respects
  `detail`: scalar `NA_real_` by default, fully shaped
  `spicy_assoc_detail` when `detail = TRUE`.
* `uncertainty_coef()` returns a finite estimate (was `NaN`) when
  a marginal is zero.
* `somers_d(direction = "symmetric")` returns the harmonic mean
  of the two asymmetric values, matching SPSS / PSPP `CROSSTABS`.
* `print.spicy_assoc_detail()` / `print.spicy_assoc_table()` use
  APA-strict `<.001` / `.045` notation, matching the rest of the
  package.
* `varlist()` / `code_book()` honour `factor_levels = "all"` for
  `haven_labelled` columns: declared-but-unobserved labels appear
  in the `Values` summary.
* `copy_clipboard()` rejects `row.names.as.col` vectors of length
  ≠ 1 and empty strings; accumulates all messages from
  `clipr::write_clip()` instead of overwriting.
* `mean_n()` / `sum_n()` reject non-integer `min_valid >= 1` and
  `min_valid > ncol`; their `digits` requires a non-negative
  integer.

## Breaking changes

* `table_continuous_lm()` and `table_categorical()` default to
  decimal-point alignment for numeric columns
  (`align = "decimal"`). Pass `align = "auto"` for the previous
  behaviour.
* `build_ascii_table()` / `spicy_print_table()`: `padding`
  switches from a string enum to a non-negative integer.
  Default `2L` (was `+5L`); printed tables are roughly 40 %
  narrower. **Migration**: `"compact" -> 0L`, `"normal" -> 2L`,
  `"wide" -> 4L`.
* `table_categorical(assoc_measure = "auto")` on a 2x2 table
  picks `phi` instead of `cramer_v`. Numeric value unchanged
  (|phi| = V on 2x2); only the column label changes.
* `freq()` drops observations with `NA` weights (with a warning)
  instead of recoding them to zero. Aligns with `cross_tab()`.
* `table_continuous_lm(output = "long")` returns `NA` in
  `es_type` / `es_value` when `effect_size = "none"` (was
  `"f2"`), and renames `sum_w` to `weighted_n`.

# spicy 0.10.0

## New features

* `code_book()` now accepts tidyselect-style variable selectors through `...`, matching `varlist()` and `vl()`.

* `code_book()` gains a `filename` argument for the base name of CSV, Excel, and PDF exports. When `NULL` (the default), the filename is derived from `title` and falls back to `"Codebook"` when needed. Filenames are sanitized to portable ASCII consistently across platforms.

* `varlist()` now summarizes matrix and array columns by their dimensions, and counts valid, missing, and distinct observations by rows.

* `freq()` gains a `factor_levels` argument that mirrors `varlist()` and `code_book()`. With `factor_levels = "all"`, declared-but-unobserved factor and labelled levels appear in the output with `n = 0`, matching SPSS `FREQUENCIES`; the default `"observed"` preserves the previous Stata `tab`-style behavior.

## Improvements

* `varlist()` now displays missing values as `<NA>` and `<NaN>` in the `Values` summary when `include_na = TRUE`, and quotes literal `"NA"`, `"NaN"`, and empty-string values so they cannot be confused with the missing markers.

* `varlist()` now emits a column-named warning and marks the failing cell as `<error: ...>` when a column cannot be summarized, instead of silently writing `"Invalid or unsupported format"`. Remaining columns are unaffected.

* `varlist()` produces more precise Viewer titles for extraction, pipe, and literal `get("name")` expressions, while keeping ambiguous dynamic calls anonymous (`vl: <data>`).

* `code_book()` now rejects partial-match names in `...` (e.g. `val = TRUE`, `tit = "x"`) that would otherwise be silently treated as tidyselect expressions, and surfaces `varlist()` selection errors directly.

* `freq()` now resolves the `weights` argument via tidy-eval, so column references nested in compound expressions (e.g. `weights = if (use_w) col else NULL`) work as expected. Qualified expressions like `weights = df2$w` continue to take precedence over column lookup.

* `freq()` validates `digits`, `sort`, `weights`, and the logical scalar arguments (`valid`, `cum`, `rescale`, `styled`) more strictly at the public boundary, with clearer error messages for non-finite values, `NA`, multi-element inputs, and non-numeric weight vectors.

* `freq()` now documents the interaction of `weights` containing `NA` with `rescale = TRUE` (Stata `pweight` semantics) and the dropping of unused factor / labelled levels (Stata `tab` semantics, with `code_book(factor_levels = "all")` as the schema-style alternative).

## Bug fixes

* `varlist()` now displays labelled values in the same prefixed-label order for compact and `values = TRUE` summaries; previously the compact summary used data order.

* `varlist(values = TRUE)` now deduplicates element types when summarizing list-columns. Previously `list(1L, 2L, "a")` produced `"List(3): character, integer, integer"`; now produces `"List(3): character, integer"`.

* `include_na = TRUE` now correctly appends `<NA>` markers for list-columns in both `varlist()` modes; previously it had no effect on this column type.

* `varlist()` now validates column names up front and gives clearer errors for missing, empty, `NA`, or duplicate names.

* `varlist()` now errors clearly when tidyselect expressions try to rename columns; `...` is for selecting variables, not renaming.

* `freq(data, x, weights = NULL)` now correctly treats the explicit `NULL` as "no weighting" instead of emitting a misleading `"variable 'NULL' not found"` error. Parameterized patterns like `weights = if (use_w) wts else NULL` are now supported.

* `print()` for `spicy_freq_table` no longer crashes when the `var_label` attribute is `NA_character_`, numeric, or multi-element; the `Label:` line is silently skipped for any value that is not a single non-empty string.

* `freq()` no longer surfaces the name of the ignored `data` vector in the printed footer when both `data` and `x` are passed as vectors. The footer now consistently shows the analyzed vector's name.

# spicy 0.9.0

## Breaking changes

* `table_continuous()` now enables inferential output by default when `by` is
  supplied. With a grouping variable, the `p` column from `test` is shown
  automatically (previous default hid it). This aligns the two table helpers:
  `table_continuous()` stays descriptive when `by` is absent, and reports the
  test *p*-value when `by` is supplied, matching `table_continuous_lm()`'s
  inferential default. To preserve the previous behavior, pass
  `p_value = FALSE` explicitly. `statistic` and `effect_size` remain `FALSE`
  by default and must still be enabled consciously.

* `varlist()` now displays observed factor levels by default in `Values`,
  matching its role as a quick inspection of the current data. Use
  `factor_levels = "all"` to display unused factor levels as well, which was
  the previous default behavior and remains the default in `code_book()`.

## Minor improvements

* `code_book()` gains a `factor_levels` argument. It defaults to `"all"` so
  exported codebooks continue to document all declared factor levels,
  including unused levels; use `"observed"` to mirror `varlist()` output.

* `freq()` now prints the `Freq.` column as integers regardless of
  `digits`, which continues to control percentage precision. This matches
  the convention of SPSS, Stata, and SAS `PROC FREQ` for weighted counts
  and keeps the two numeric concepts (discrete counts vs. continuous
  percentages) visually distinct.

* `freq(..., styled = FALSE)` now returns a genuinely plain `data.frame`
  with no `spicy_freq_table` rendering metadata clinging to it, so
  `str()`, `dput()`, and downstream programmatic use see only the
  tabulation columns. The metadata attributes (`digits`, `data_name`,
  `var_name`, `var_label`, `class_name`, `n_total`, `n_valid`,
  `weighted`, `rescaled`, `weight_var`) are now documented in
  `@return` and remain available on the invisibly returned
  `spicy_freq_table` object when `styled = TRUE` (the default).

* `table_continuous_lm()` documentation now clarifies why `p_value = TRUE`
  and `r2 = "r2"` are the defaults, and robust-variance fallback warnings
  are now more explicit when a model matrix is singular.

## Bug fixes

* `freq()` now correctly resolves qualified weight expressions such as
  `weights = other$w` or `weights = other[["w"]]` even when the referenced
  column name also exists in `data`. Previously the bare-name fallback
  could silently pull the weight vector from the wrong data frame when
  column names collided.

* `freq()` with `sort` and missing values now keeps the `NA` row at the
  end of the tabulation so the printed `Cum. Percent` and
  `Cum. Valid Percent` columns stay monotonic and match the
  Valid → Missing → Total display layout. Sorting previously could push
  the `NA` row between valid rows and make cumulative percentages appear
  to jump.

* `varlist()` now preserves literal `"NA"` and empty-string values in the
  `Values` summary instead of removing them as if they were missing values.

* `varlist()` now distinguishes actual `NA` values from `NaN` in the
  `Values` summary when `include_na = TRUE`.

* `varlist(values = TRUE)` now preserves factor level order in the
  `Values` summary, matching the default compact factor display.

* `varlist()` now validates `values`, `tbl`, and `include_na` up front and
  gives a clear error when one of them is not `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

# spicy 0.8.0

## New features

* `table_continuous_lm()` adds APA-style bivariate linear-model tables for continuous outcomes. It acts as the model-based companion to `table_continuous()` for reporting fitted mean comparisons or slopes in an `lm` framework, with one predictor per model, model-based means for categorical predictors, optional case weights, classical or HC0-HC5 variance estimators, multiple output formats (ASCII, tinytable, gt, flextable, Excel, clipboard, and Word), `output = "data.frame"` for the wide raw table, `output = "long"` for the analytic long table, and configurable display of tests, confidence intervals, fit statistics, and effect sizes.

## Minor improvements

* Installed package vignettes now avoid embedding heavy HTML table and codebook widgets during CRAN builds, reducing package size while preserving rich pkgdown article rendering.

* Website and vignette coverage now includes `table_continuous_lm()`, using the bundled `sochealth` data throughout and adding a dedicated article for model-based continuous summary tables.

* `table_continuous()` and `table_continuous_lm()` now support dedicated display precision for effect-size columns, and `table_continuous_lm()` also supports separate precision for `R²` columns, so model fit and effect sizes can be formatted independently from descriptive values and test statistics.

* `table_continuous_lm()` now keeps `n` as the unweighted analytic sample size in wide and rendered outputs, and can optionally add a separate `Weighted n` column reporting the sum of case weights.

# spicy 0.7.0

## New features

* `table_continuous()` is a new helper for continuous summary tables. It computes descriptive statistics (mean, SD, min, max, confidence interval of the mean, and n) for numeric variables, with tidyselect column selection, optional grouping via `by`, and multiple output formats (ASCII, tinytable, gt, flextable, Excel, clipboard, and Word).

* `table_continuous()` gains `effect_size` and `effect_size_ci` arguments. When `by` is used, `effect_size = TRUE` adds an "ES" column with the appropriate measure (Hedges' g, eta-squared, rank-biserial `r_rb`, or epsilon-squared) chosen automatically based on the test method and number of groups, and `effect_size_ci = TRUE` appends the confidence interval in brackets.

* `table_continuous()` gains a `test` argument (`"welch"`, `"student"`, or `"nonparametric"`) to choose the group-comparison method, along with independent `p_value` and `statistic` display toggles so users can request either or both outputs when `by` is used.

* ASCII console tables now split oversized outputs into stacked horizontal panels, repeating the left-most identifier columns so wide `freq()`, `cross_tab()`, `table_categorical()`, and `table_continuous()` prints stay readable in narrow consoles.

## Breaking changes

* `table_categorical()` replaces `table_apa()` as the public helper for categorical summary tables. It uses `select` and `by`, supports grouped cross-tabulation or one-way frequency-style tables when `by = NULL`, and consolidates output formats under a single `output` argument. Migrate existing `table_apa()` calls to `table_categorical()`, use `output = "default"` for ASCII tables and `output = "data.frame"` for plain data frames, and replace former `output = "wide"` / `style = "report"` paths with the formatted output engines.

* Excel export now uses `openxlsx2` instead of `openxlsx` for a lighter dependency footprint (no Rcpp compilation required).

## Minor improvements

* Package citation metadata now uses the current package title and CRAN DOI, so `citation("spicy")` matches `DESCRIPTION` and points to the package DOI.

* `table_categorical()` and `table_continuous()` now print shorter ASCII titles without appending the input data frame name, and no longer require `officer` for `output = "flextable"` alone; `officer` is now required only for Word export paths that actually write `.docx` files.

* `table_continuous()` now accepts tidyselect syntax in `exclude` in addition to character vectors, and no longer warns that `test` is ignored when it is still needed to compute effect sizes.

# spicy 0.6.0

## New features

* New family of association measure functions for contingency tables: `assoc_measures()`, `contingency_coef()`, `gamma_gk()`, `goodman_kruskal_tau()`, `kendall_tau_b()`, `kendall_tau_c()`, `lambda_gk()`, `phi()`, `somers_d()`, `uncertainty_coef()`, and `yule_q()`. Each returns a numeric scalar by default; pass `detail = TRUE` for a named vector with estimate, confidence interval, and p-value.

* `cross_tab()` gains `assoc_measure` and `assoc_ci` arguments. When both variables are ordered factors, it automatically selects Kendall's Tau-b instead of Cramer's V. The note format changes from `Chi-2: 18.0 (df = 4)` to `Chi-2(4) = 18.0`. Numeric attributes (`chi2`, `df`, `p_value`, `assoc_measure`, `assoc_value`, `assoc_result`) are now attached to the output data frame.

* `table_apa()` now dynamically labels the association measure column based on the measure used, instead of always showing "Cramer's V". New `assoc_measure` and `assoc_ci` arguments are passed through to `cross_tab()`.

* `table_apa()` gains `output = "gt"` to produce a `gt_tbl` object with APA-style formatting, column spanners, and alignment.

* `table_apa()` now correctly centers spanner labels over their column pairs in `tinytable` and `flextable` output.

* All association measure functions and `assoc_measures()` gain a `digits` argument (default 3) that controls the number of decimal places when printed. The p-value always uses 3 decimal places or `< 0.001`.

* `detail = TRUE` results now print with formatted output (aligned columns, fixed decimal places) via a new `print.spicy_assoc_detail()` method. `assoc_measures()` output uses a new `print.spicy_assoc_table()` method with the same formatting.

* New bundled dataset `sochealth`: a simulated social-health survey (n = 1200, 24 variables) with variable labels, ordered factors, survey weights, and missing values. Includes four Likert-scaled life satisfaction items (`life_sat_health`, `life_sat_work`, `life_sat_relationships`, `life_sat_standard`) for demonstrating `mean_n()`, `sum_n()`, and `count_n()`.

## Bug fixes

* `count_n()` now correctly counts `NA` values when `count = NA` and `strict = TRUE` are both used. List columns are now reported in verbose mode instead of causing silent errors.

* `cross_tab()` rescale logic now operates on complete cases only, so the weighted total N matches the unweighted N when missing values are present (consistent with Stata behavior).

* `freq()` now uses true `NA` consistently (instead of the `"<NA>"` string) in both weighted and unweighted paths. `cum_valid_prop` is now correctly `NA` for missing rows. Invalid `digits` and `sort` values are rejected with clear error messages.

* `mean_n()` and `sum_n()` now validate `min_valid` and `digits` arguments, rejecting non-numeric, negative, or multi-element values.

* `mean_n()`, `sum_n()`, and `count_n()` no longer trigger a tidyselect deprecation warning when `select` receives a character vector. Character vectors are now automatically wrapped with `all_of()`.

* `table_apa()` now preserves the original factor level order in row variables instead of sorting alphabetically. When `drop_na = FALSE`, the `(Missing)` category is placed at the bottom of each variable's levels. `percent_digits`, `p_digits`, and `v_digits` are now validated.

* `table_apa()` p-values no longer wrap across lines in `tinytable` HTML output.

## Breaking changes

* `cramer_v()` now accepts a `detail` argument. By default it returns a numeric scalar (as before). Pass `detail = TRUE` to get a 4-element named vector (`estimate`, `ci_lower`, `ci_upper`, `p_value`), or `detail = TRUE, conf_level = NULL` for a 2-element vector (`estimate`, `p_value`) without CI.

# spicy 0.5.0

## New features

* New `table_apa()` helper to build APA-ready cross-tab reports with multiple output formats (`wide`, `long`, `tinytable`, `flextable`, `excel`, `clipboard`, `word`).
* `table_apa()` exposes key `cross_tab()` controls for weighting and inference (`weights`, `rescale`, `correct`, `simulate_p`, `simulate_B`) and now handles missing values explicitly when `drop_na = FALSE`.

## Bug fixes

* `count_n()` no longer crashes when `special = "NaN"` is used with non-numeric columns. Passing `count = NA` now errors with a message directing to `special = "NA"`.
* `cross_tab()` fixes a spurious rescale warning for explicit all-ones weights and aligns the Cramer's V formula with `cramer_v()`.
* `table_apa()` no longer leaks global options on error. The `simulate_p` default is aligned to `FALSE`.
* `varlist()` title generation no longer crashes on unrecognizable expressions.

## Minor improvements

* `copy_clipboard()` parameter `message` renamed to `show_message`.
* `freq()` now dispatches printing correctly via S3.
* Removed unused `collapse` and `stringi` from `Imports`.

# spicy 0.4.2

* `cross_tab()` hardening: improved vector-mode detection (including labelled vectors), stricter weight validation, safer rescaling, and clearer early errors (e.g., explicit `y = NULL`).
* `cross_tab()` statistics are now computed on non-empty margins in grouped tables, avoiding spurious `NA` results; internal core path refactored to remove `dplyr`/`tibble` from computation while preserving user-facing behavior.
* `freq()` now errors clearly when `x` is missing for data.frame input and validates rescaling when weight sums are zero/non-finite.
* `count_n()`, `mean_n()`, and `sum_n()` regex mode is hardened (`regex = TRUE` now validates/defaults `select` safely).
* `mean_n()` and `sum_n()` now return `NA` (with warning) when no numeric columns are selected.
* `label_from_names()` now validates input type (`data.frame`/tibble required).
* `cramer_v()` now returns `NA` with warning for degenerate tables.
* Dependency optimization: `DT` and `clipr` moved to `Suggests`; optional runtime checks added in `code_book()` and `copy_clipboard()`.
* Tests expanded with regression coverage for all the above edge cases.

# spicy 0.4.1

* Fixed CRAN incoming check notes by removing non-standard top-level files.

# spicy 0.4.0

* Print methods have been fully redesigned to produce clean, aligned ASCII tables inspired by Stata's layout. The new implementation improves formatting, adds optional color support, and provides more consistent handling of totals and column spacing.

* Output from `freq()` and `cross_tab()` now benefits from the enhanced
  `print.spicy()` formatting, offering clearer, more readable summary tables.

* Documentation and internal tests were updated for clarity and consistency.

* `cross_tab()` gains an explicit `correct` argument to control the use of
  Yates' continuity correction for Chi-squared tests in 2x2 tables. The default
  behavior remains unchanged.

* The documentation of `cross_tab()` was refined and harmonized, with a clearer
  high-level description, improved parameter wording, and expanded examples.

* Minor cosmetic improvements were made to `varlist()` output: the title prefix
  now uses `vl:` instead of `VARLIST`, and the column name `Ndist_val` was renamed
  to `N_distinct` for improved readability and consistency.

* Minor cosmetic improvement: ASCII table output no longer includes a closing
  bottom rule by default.

# spicy 0.3.0

* New function `code_book()`, which generates a comprehensive variable
  codebook that can be viewed interactively and exported to multiple
  formats (copy, print, CSV, Excel, PDF).

# spicy 0.2.1

* `label_from_names()` now correctly handles edge cases when the
  separator appears in the label or is missing.

# spicy 0.2.0

* New function `label_from_names()` to derive and assign variable labels
  from headers of the form `"name<sep>label"` (e.g. `"name. label"`).
  Especially useful for LimeSurvey CSV exports (*Export results* ->
  *CSV* -> *Headings: Question code & question text*), where the default
  separator is `". "`.

# spicy 0.1.0

## Initial release

* Introduces a collection of tools for variable inspection, descriptive
  summaries, and data exploration.
* Provides functions to:
  * Extract variable metadata and display compact summaries (`varlist()`).
  * Compute frequency tables (`freq()`), cross-tabulations (`cross_tab()`),
    and Cramer's V for categorical associations (`cramer_v()`).
  * Generate descriptive statistics such as means (`mean_n()`), sums
    (`sum_n()`), and counts (`count_n()`) with automatic handling of
    missing data.
  * Copy data (`copy_clipboard()`) directly to the clipboard for quick export.
