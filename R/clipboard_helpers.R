# Helpers shared by every clipboard (delimited text) export.
#
# A clipboard payload is plain delimited text: the user pastes it into
# a text editor, a spreadsheet or a word processor. Three rules make
# that text survive the trip, and all three live here so that no
# engine can implement them differently:
#
#   * CELLS ARE ESCAPED. `paste(collapse = delim)` alone loses the
#     grid as soon as a cell holds the delimiter -- a level label with
#     a comma under `clipboard_delim = ","`, or EVERY number under
#     `decimal_mark = ","`. Cells holding the delimiter, a double
#     quote or a line break are quoted RFC 4180-style (embedded
#     quotes doubled), which every spreadsheet and CSV/TSV reader
#     understands. A quote left unescaped is not cosmetic: base R's
#     `read.delim()` silently DROPS it and the cell arrives altered.
#
#   * CELLS ARE PLAIN. The decimal-alignment padding of the console
#     and of the rich engines uses U+2007 FIGURE SPACE, which a
#     parser does not treat as whitespace: a padded number arrives as
#     text next to an unpadded sibling that arrives as a number, so a
#     single column silently splits into two types. Clipboard cells
#     ship unpadded -- alignment belongs to the fixed-width console
#     renderer, not to a delimited payload.
#
#   * CELLS ARE LITERAL. Nothing is wrapped in an Excel text formula
#     (`="..."`): that markup is meaningless in the two other
#     documented paste targets, where it shows up verbatim.
#
# The row layout (title row, header row(s), body, note rows -- each
# padded to the full column count) is the one `clipboard_payload()`
# established for regression tables; the descriptive tables reuse it
# through these helpers.

# Pre-flight of a clipboard route: the package, then the system
# clipboard itself. A headless session (CI, ssh) has no clipboard;
# without the second probe clipr fails deeper with its own error
# instead of spicy's actionable one. Message and class match the
# table_regression() validator, so every family fails the same way.
