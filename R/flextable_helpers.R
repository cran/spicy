# Attach a table note to a gt table built by `table_categorical()` /

# `print.spicy_gt()` / `knit_print.spicy_gt()`, which inject it as a
# `<div>` outside the table in HTML and fall back to the native source
# note for non-HTML knit targets.
# The note is attached TWICE, on purpose -- the same reasoning
# `output_gt()` records for the regression family.
#
# 1. `gt::tab_source_note()` puts it on the gt object itself, so it
#    survives every route to a rendered table: `gt::gtsave()`,
#    `gt::as_raw_html()`, `as_latex()`, `as_word()`, a non-interactive
#    `print()`. Without it those deliverables shipped a TITLED table
#    stripped of the disclosure the console prints -- which missing
#    values were removed, which test each block ran, that the blocks
#    are not adjusted for one another. The twin of the title hole, on
#    the same engine.
# 2. The `spicy_gt` tag routes it through `print.spicy_gt()` /
#    `knit_print.spicy_gt()`, which inject it as a `<div>` OUTSIDE the
#    table in HTML -- gt's own `<tfoot>` colspan cell widens the table
#    in narrow viewports. Those methods drop the native note when they
#    take over, so the two never print together.

# The gt column id of every column KEY, named by the key.
#
# `gt::gt()` reads the data frame's column NAMES as the ids it writes
# into the rendered DOM, and in four of the families those names carry
# user data: a `by` level ("Q\"x_n"), a marginal mean ("M (Q\"x)"), a
# model name ("M\"1: B"). gt escapes the id where it lands in `id="..."`
# on the `<th>`, but the `headers="..."` attribute it writes on every
# body cell takes the name RAW. A level holding a double quote closes
# that attribute early and the remainder is re-parsed as bare
# attributes: `M (Q"x)` renders as `headers="M (Q" x)`. The same raw id
# is interpolated into the `th[id="%s"]` CSS selectors these branches
# build, where a double quote aborted sass ("unterminated attribute
# selector for id") and took the whole render down.
#
# So the KEY and the gt id part company here, exactly as the key and the
# header already have: the key stays the public column name
# `output = "data.frame"` publishes and `col_meta` is indexed by, the id
# is DOM state. Nothing a reader sees moves -- the visible text is
# carried by the spanner / column label above, which gt escapes
# correctly.
#
# Only the characters that cannot survive an HTML attribute value or a
# CSS string are replaced: the double quote, the two angle brackets, the
# backslash (CSS's own escape) and the control characters. Every other
# name is returned untouched, so a table of ordinary names renders byte
# for byte as it did before. `make.unique()` breaks a tie the
# replacement could create ("a\"b" and "a<b" both land as "a_b"); the
# keys are data frame column names, so a set with no collision comes
# back exactly as it went in.
# Second pass, added for n. 213 / n. 218: gt does not write our id into
# the DOM as we hand it over. `gt:::valid_html_id()` collapses every run
# of WHITESPACE to a single "-", which can RE-MERGE two ids make.unique()
# has just declared distinct. Two `by` levels "A B" and "A-B" both land on
# `A-B_n`: the two `<th>` share one DOM id and every body cell's
# `headers="A-B_n"` then points at both, so a screen reader announces the
# wrong group and a `th[id=]` rule styles two columns at once. (In the
# spanner position gt escapes the id instead of normalising it, so
# spanners never collide this way -- measured on gt 1.3.0.)
#
# The tie is broken on a SHADOW of the id -- the form gt will actually
# emit -- and the suffix make.unique() would have given is transplanted
# onto the real id. A set whose shadows are already distinct comes back
# untouched, so an ordinary table (including every frozen key with a
# space in it, "95% CI LL" and friends) renders byte for byte as before.
# One pass converges: the suffix carries no whitespace, so the suffixed
# id's own shadow is exactly the unique shadow it was given.

# Escape a value for interpolation INSIDE a double-quoted CSS string,
# as in the `th[id="..."]` attribute selectors the gt branches build.
# Most of those ids are frozen ASCII keys, but the categorical group
# columns are named after the `by` levels, which are user data: a level
# holding a double quote closed the string early and gt's own sass
# compiler aborted the whole render ("unterminated attribute selector
# for id").
#
# CSS escapes with a backslash, like R, so the backslash goes first.
#
# The newline is escaped for SYNTAX only -- a literal newline cannot
# appear in a CSS string -- and not because the rule would then land.
# It does not, either way, and the six-hex-digit form is not the shield
# it looks like: sass re-serialises our `\00000A` to the short `\ab`
# form, which swallows the character that follows and compiles to
# `th[id="a<U+00AB>_n"]`. Measured.
#
# The target id is not the level in the first place. gt passes every id
# through `gt:::valid_html_id()`, which prefixes "a" to anything not
# starting `[A-z]` and then collapses each run of WHITESPACE to a single
# "-". The newline is not special to it: measured on gt 1.3.0, a level
# "a b" lands as `Upper-secondary_n` against our `th[id="Upper
# secondary_n"]` exactly as "a\nb" does, and an accented level lands as
# `aété_n` against `th[id="été_n"]`. So an ordinary SPACE in a `by`
# level already costs this rule -- the newline is one case of a general
# mismatch, not a corner. Mirroring the mapping means copying an
# unexported internal, `[A-z]` quirk included, into a selector that
# raises nothing when it stops matching; the row's border is drawn by
# gt's own `tab_style()` as well, so what is lost is the override that
# carries it into the viewers where gt's inline styles do not survive.
# Left to a decision, recorded in the register.
#
# What the escape does prevent is the stylesheet failing to parse, which
# for the double quote took the whole render down.
