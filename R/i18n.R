# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# spicy's display-string registry, and the layer that resolves a key to the
# label a reader sees.
#
# Every string a reader of a spicy TABLE sees -- column headers, row labels,
# cell contents, titles, table footnotes -- lives here and nowhere else.
# Deliberately NOT here (see dev/i18n_string_census.md section 6):
#   * R conditions (errors, warnings, messages): they stay English, they are
#     read by developers and quoted in bug reports;
#   * argument token VALUES ("welch", "HC3", "refit"): API identifiers;
#   * public output COLUMN NAMES (`Variable`, `Level`, `N_valid`, ...): a
#     documented contract that user code indexes into.
#
# Keys are stable; values are the English defaults. A key is never derived
# from its value, and no mechanism of the package may branch on a displayed
# string -- see dev/i18n_string_census.md section 1.6. That rule is what
# makes the resolution below safe: a translated label moves the text a
# reader sees and nothing else, because the frozen half of every couple
# (the column name, the block identity, the encoded token) is a constant
# written out in the source and never read from here.
#
# `spicy_str()` resolves, in order:
#   getOption("spicy.labels")[[key]] -> language set -> English default.
# `spicy_fmt()` is untouched: it formats whatever `spicy_str()` returns, so
# a set whose grammar needs the holes in another order writes them in the
# positional form (`%1$s`) and nothing else changes.
#
# Non-ASCII glyphs are written as \uXXXX escapes, as everywhere else in the
# package (CRAN portability; see dev/fix_nonascii.R).

#' Table labels and their language
#'
#' @description
#' Every string a reader of a spicy table sees -- column headers, row
#' labels, titles, table footnotes -- is held under a stable key, and
#' `spicy_labels()` returns those keys with the label each one currently
#' resolves to. It is the companion of the two options that move them.
#'
#' @section Global options:
#'
#' * **`options(spicy.language = "fr")`**
#'   The language of the table, for the whole document -- its labels and
#'   the typography its numbers are written in. Two sets ship:
#'   `"en"` (the default) and `"fr"`. The language of a report is a
#'   property of the report, so this is set once in a setup chunk rather
#'   than passed to each table.
#'
#' * **`options(spicy.labels = list(<key> = "<label>"))`**
#'   A per-label override, for the case where one word has to change and
#'   a language does not: a named list (or named character vector) whose
#'   names are keys of `spicy_labels()`. An unknown key is an error.
#'
#' A label resolves through `spicy.labels`, then the `spicy.language`
#' set, then English. A set carries only the keys it translates, so
#' anything it does not name falls back to English rather than erroring
#' or coming out blank. Both options are cleared with `NULL`.
#'
#' @section What a language does not change:
#'
#' Only DISPLAY strings translate. The column names of the exported
#' frames (`as.data.frame()`, `tidy()`, `as_structured()`) are a
#' documented contract that user code indexes into, so `out[["Yes %"]]`
#' resolves under every language, and so do the block identities, the
#' encoded cell tokens and the mathematical glyphs. Errors, warnings and
#' messages stay English: they are read by developers and quoted in bug
#' reports.
#'
#' One exception, and it follows from the same rule. A column named
#' after a LEVEL of `by` takes that level's own spelling -- which is why
#' `"Yes %"` stays `"Yes %"`: your data is never translated. spicy's own
#' missing category is such a level, so it is the one name that does
#' move: `table_categorical(by = )` on a variable with missing values
#' gives `"(Missing) n"` in English and `"(Manquant) n"` under `"fr"`
#' (or whatever `row_missing_level` is overridden to). Address that
#' column through `row_missing_level` rather than by typing it.
#'
#' @section Numbers follow the language too:
#'
#' A language brings its typographic locale with it, so
#' `options(spicy.language = "fr")` is one gesture for a coherent
#' French report table: French words, comma decimal mark, and the
#' leading zero French typography keeps on a p-value (`0,003`). The
#' sources are the BIPM's SI brochure and the European Union's *Code
#' de redaction interinstitutionnel*; [spicy_style()] quotes them.
#' `"en"` brings no locale, and nothing changes for anyone who sets no
#' language.
#'
#' The locale rides the style layer, so it reaches the reporting
#' families -- [table_regression()], [table_categorical()],
#' [table_continuous()], [table_continuous_lm()], [table_outcome()]
#' and the survey twins. The language reaches every table, the
#' exploration pair included: [freq()] and [cross_tab()] have no
#' style layer, so it sets the DEFAULT of their `decimal_mark` -- the
#' one typographic lever they carry -- and an argument you type wins
#' over it. Under a comma their p-value keeps its leading zero
#' (`p = 0,659`), the form French typography requires.
#'
#' The locale sits at the BOTTOM of the formatting resolution. A
#' journal style outranks it -- `style = "jama"` under `"fr"` gives
#' JAMA's p-values and the French comma, `style = "lancet"` keeps the
#' journal's midline decimal point -- and an argument you type outranks
#' both, so `decimal_mark = "."` gives French words with a decimal
#' point (the p-value keeps its locale zero; [spicy_style()] documents
#' that lever).
#'
#' Two timing notes. Figures are frozen when a table is BUILT, like
#' every formatting argument, while words resolve when it is printed --
#' so set the language once, at the top of the document. And a comma
#' mark makes an Excel export write its body as text rather than live
#' numbers, since Excel would otherwise re-punctuate a numeric cell
#' with the viewer's own locale.
#'
#' @param language A language name (`"en"`, `"fr"`), or `NULL` (the
#'   default) to report the labels in force. Any
#'   `options(spicy.labels)` override applies either way.
#'
#' @return A named character vector, one element per key, in registry
#'   order.
#'
#' @seealso [spicy_style()] for the journal styles, which outrank the
#'   language's own typography.
#'
#' @examples
#' head(spicy_labels())
#'
#' # The same keys in French.
#' fr <- spicy_labels("fr")
#' fr[["header_mean"]]
#' fr[["row_missing_level"]]

#' # variable is a refusal to answer here, not an absent value.

# fractional level -- `97.5% CI` at `ci_level = 0.975` -- and an
# orphaned interval column silently kept its bare header instead of
# naming its carrier. The mark class covers the marks the package
# writes (decision 27): the period, the comma, and the Lancet midline
