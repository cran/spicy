# inline(): cite one formatted table cell in running text.
#
# The whole design rests on two pillars of the structured contract
# (see ?as_structured):
#   * ADDRESSING BY IDENTITY -- rows are found through `.variable` /
#     `.level` / `.row_role`, never by parsing display labels, so a
#     call survives custom `labels`, journal styles, and translation;
#   * THE SHARED FORMATTER -- the cell text comes from
#     .format_structured_to_string_body(), the exact function the
#     fidelity tests pin against the console, so a number quoted in
#     the text can never drift from the number printed in the table.
#
# The second pillar needs the table's STYLE back in force. Half a
# style travels in the typed contract (`digits`, `p_digits`,
# `decimal_mark` are formals, so they are already baked into
# `col_meta`); the other half -- `p_bands`, `p_sigfig`, `p_floor`,
# `ci_sep`, `ci_brackets` -- has no formal and lives in the
# call-scoped format context, which is long gone by the time a
# sentence cites a cell. `.style_restore()` puts it back for the
# length of the call.

#' Cite a table cell in inline text
#'
#' @description
#' Returns one cell of a spicy table as a character scalar, formatted
#' exactly as the table displays it -- same decimals, same *p* style,
#' same interval punctuation, same journal style. Designed for inline
#' R chunks in Quarto / R Markdown:
#'
#' ```
#' Smokers had higher odds (`r inline(tbl, smoking, "Yes", "or")`).
#' ```
#'
#' @details
#' # Addressing
#'
#' The row is found by **identity**, not by display text: `variable`
#' names the source column (`.variable` in the typed body), `level`
#' the level (`.level`). Custom `labels`, a `style`, or a translated
#' display never change the call. As a convenience, a `variable`
#' that matches no source column is looked up among the displayed
#' labels before erroring. The missing-value category is addressed by
#' `level = "(Missing)"` whatever its displayed (possibly deduplicated)
#' label, through its row role. Fit statistics are addressed by their
#' token as `variable` (`inline(tbl, "n")`, `inline(tbl, "r2")`).
#'
#' A statistic that belongs to a whole variable rather than to one of
#' its levels sits on the variable's own row: the *p* of a
#' `table_categorical()` block, its association measure, its SMD. Leave
#' `level` out to cite it (`inline(tbl, smoking, column = "p")`).
#'
#' [table_continuous_lm()] lays its groups out sideways -- one row per
#' outcome, the `by` levels as columns (`M (Female)`, `M (Male)`) --
#' so there `level` names the group whose column you want:
#' `inline(tbl, bmi, "Female", "emmean")`. The columns that belong to
#' no group (the contrast, its interval, `p`, `n`) are cited without
#' one, as before.
#'
#' The column is a **token** of the typed contract (`"b"`, `"se"`,
#' `"p"`, `"ci"`, `"or"`, `"ame"`, `"n"`, `"pct"`, `"m"`, ... -- see
#' `as_structured()`'s `col_meta`), never a display header. `"ci"`
#' composes the interval with the style's brackets and separator, and
#' so does every other interval token the table carries (`"med_ci"`,
#' `"ame_ci"`, `"assoc_ci"`): each addresses its own bounds. In
#' a multi-model table, `model` selects the model by its spanner
#' label or position; in a `by` table, the spanners are the groups,
#' so `model` selects the group the same way.
#'
#' # Patterns
#'
#' A `column` containing `{` is a pattern: each `{token}` is replaced
#' by the corresponding cell, so one call quotes a full sentence
#' fragment:
#'
#' ```
#' inline(tbl, smoking, "Yes", "{or} ({ci_label} {ci}; p = {p})")
#' ```
#'
#' `{ci_label}` inserts the interval label of the interval the pattern
#' cites (`95% CI`, or `Med 95% CI` in a pattern quoting `{med_ci}`) --
#' the first one when it cites several, the table's first when it cites
#' none. Note that `{p}` carries the floor operator when the table does
#' (`<.001`), so write `p {p}` rather than `p = {p}` in patterns that
#' may hit the floor.
#'
#' # Errors
#'
#' Every misaddressing is a classed error that lists the available
#' choices: unknown variables list the variables, missing levels list
#' the levels, unknown tokens list the table's tokens, ambiguous
#' models list the spanner labels. A cell the table itself displays
#' as undefined (an aliased coefficient's en-dash) refuses with the
#' reason rather than pasting a dash into a sentence.
#'
#' @param x A table returned by [table_regression()],
#'   [table_categorical()], [table_continuous()],
#'   [table_continuous_lm()], [table_outcome()],
#'   [table_categorical_svy()] or [table_continuous_svy()] (default
#'   output) -- every family [as_structured()] accepts.
#' @param variable The source variable, unquoted or as a string; or a
#'   fit-statistic token (`"n"`, `"r2"`, ...).
#' @param level For a factor variable, the level, as a string.
#'   `"(Missing)"` addresses the missing-value category by role. On
#'   [table_continuous_lm()], whose groups are columns rather than
#'   rows, it names the group.
#' @param column A column token, or a `{token}` pattern. `NULL` (the
#'   default) returns the estimate-like column of the row when it is
#'   unambiguous: the family's primary estimate. That is the
#'   coefficient for [table_regression()] -- always token `"b"`: an
#'   exponentiated table changes its header to OR, IRR or HR, never
#'   its token -- the contrast (`"delta"`) or, across a numeric `by`,
#'   the slope (`"b"`) for [table_continuous_lm()], the mean (`"m"`)
#'   or, on a median-only table, the median (`"med"`, `"med_iqr"`) for
#'   [table_continuous()], and the count (`"n"`) for
#'   [table_categorical()]. A row carrying none of them refuses and
#'   lists its tokens.
#' @param model In a multi-model table, the model: its label (as
#'   displayed in the column spanners) or its position.
#'
#' @return A character scalar.
#'
#' @seealso [as_structured()] for the typed contract behind the
