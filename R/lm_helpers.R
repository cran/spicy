# may be factor, character, integer, or any atomic type.

# Multi-way clustering (`cluster = list(c1, c2)`) is intentionally
# not supported in this iteration, because the canonical R backends
# disagree: clubSandwich (used here for CR2/CR3 with Satterthwaite
# df) only supports a single cluster vector, while sandwich::vcovCL
# supports multi-way but only at CR0/CR1. A future release may add a
# dedicated `multiway` argument that routes to sandwich::vcovCL.
#
# NOT a duplicate of resolve_cluster() (R/abort.R), despite the name:
# that one resolves against a FITTED MODEL's model.frame (formula /
# string / vector forms, per model in multi-model tables), while this
# one tidy-evaluates a quosure against the raw DATA of the
# descriptive-table functions. The contracts (inputs, error surface,
# lookup scope) differ enough that merging them would couple the two
# call families for no shared logic beyond "return a vector".
