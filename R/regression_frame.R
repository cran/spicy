# as_regression_frame() generic + validator.
#
# Internal S3 generic that produces a standardised data frame from a fitted
# regression model object, plus a per-model metadata list. Sits upstream of
# build_structured_body() in the rendering pipeline.
#
# This file ships the generic, the default fallback, the schema validator,
# and the version constant. Per-class methods (lm, glm, ...) live in
# regression_frame_lm.R and similar siblings.
#
# Design: dev/design_as_regression_frame.md (single source of truth).
# Status: LIVE. table_regression() builds frames and nothing else -- every
# downstream renderer (title, footer, alignment, body, nested LRT) consumes
# them directly, and the legacy extract shape and its adapter are gone (see
# table_regression.R, "orchestrator now builds ONLY the frames list").
# extract_lm_phase1() survives only as the lm / glm extraction engine behind
# .legacy_to_frame() (regression_frame_lm.R), one method's internals rather
# than a parallel pipeline.
#
# Q2 settlement (dev/design_as_regression_frame.md): this generic stays
# INTERNAL throughout the 0.x cycle. No @export. No public reference page.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---- Version constant -----------------------------------------------------

# Schema version attached as attr(frame, "spicy_frame_version"). Bumped only
# on documented-breaking schema changes (rename or remove a field; change
# semantics of a field). Additive changes do NOT bump. See design doc §5.

# ---- Schema constructors --------------------------------------------------

# Default capability flags: every capability is FALSE unless a method opts in.
# new_regression_frame() merges a method's `info$supports` onto this, so a
# method need only set the flags it supports and any newly-added flag
# defaults safely across all ~30 classes. This list is ALSO the
# single source of truth for the supports field set the validator requires.
# The class names to PUT IN A MESSAGE for a set of frames. Normally
# `info$class`, except for the univariable screen, whose frame is a
# composite named `uv_screen`: a refusal citing that name would name an
# internal object rather than the models the user passed, so the screen
# publishes the classes it stands for in `extras$screen_classes` and
# they are spliced in here. Read by the capability guards in
# table_regression().

# internally. "classical" is the historical synonym: it is what the user
# still types in `vcov = "classical"` and what sandwich-free branches of
# the lm / MASS / geepack builders passed straight through, so ~25
# builders wrote "model" while four wrote "classical" for the same thing.
# Every consumer then carried the ambiguity as a literal disjunction,
# `%in% c("model", "classical")`, in 14 files -- and two of them, three
# lines apart in the same file, disagreed about which spelling a MISSING
# value should default to.
#
# The synonym is not removed from the user's vocabulary; it is normalised
# out of the FRAME's. new_regression_frame() canonicalises on the way in,
# .frame_vcov_kind() canonicalises on the way out (for frames built by
# hand or by older code), and .validate_info() asserts the closed set.

# spicy estimator produces -- estimatr's own HC (`robust`), the Bayesian

  # tobit -> .survreg, glm.nb-style fixest -> .lm). A schema violation is
  # therefore attributed to the method that CREATED it, at the line that
  # created it, rather than surfacing later as an unrelated rendering
  # anomaly downstream (4ff93cda is the bug class this exists to stop).
  #
  # This site cannot be the only one: the methods that keep editing their
  # frame after this returns (negbin, tobit, and the five that attach
  # event counts) are seen here only in their PRE-mutation state. Their
  # final state is checked at the mutation sites themselves and again at
  # the dispatch boundary, as_regression_frame_validated(). See that

# "Residual" is not a name in the variance-components frame, it is a KEY.
# Every mixed engine writes the residual row as group = "Residual",
# term = "", and every consumer reads that string back to find the
# residual: the SE / CI walks (nlme, glmmTMB), the ICC kernel
# (`setdiff(unique(group), "Residual")`), the block sort, the null-model
# LR test, the footer panel. A grouping factor a user happens to have
# named `Residual` therefore does not merely look like the residual -- it
# IS the residual as far as those seven readers are concerned.
#
# What that produced, measured on `lme(distance ~ age, random = ~ 1 |
# Residual)`: the group's variance row (4.47) rendered with the RESIDUAL's
# interval, [1.50, 2.79] -- an interval that does not contain its own
# estimate -- because the name-keyed branch of the SE walk fired for both
# rows. The ICC went silently NA on every engine, since subtracting the
# reserved key left no grouping factor at all.
#
# Disambiguating would mean giving the residual an internal key no data
# value can collide with and migrating all seven readers plus five
# engines onto it: a change to the frame contract, not a guard. Fixing
# only the walk that was caught would leave the ICC, the sort and the
# footer keyed on the collision and hide the rest of the damage. So the
# frame refuses to be built, at the one place every engine passes
# through, and says which word is taken and what to do about it. The

# it in all five engines.

#
# Per design doc §2, the return value carries two attributes:

#   * fit                : reference to the original fit object; read by

# ---- The DISPATCH boundary ------------------------------------------------
#
# The validating front door to the generic above, and the ONLY way the
# pipeline is allowed to obtain a frame: table_regression() (the
# orchestrator loop) and table_regression_uv() (per wrapped fit) both
# call this, never `as_regression_frame()` directly.
#
# Why the check is here and not one line higher, inside the generic:
# UseMethod() returns from the generic's own frame, so nothing written
# after it ever runs, and moving the dispatch into a shim so the check
# could follow it would strip the literal `UseMethod` call out of
# `body(as_regression_frame)`. utils:::findGeneric() reads exactly that
# body to decide whether a function is an S3 generic -- and with it gone
# `utils::getS3method("as_regression_frame", cl)` stops resolving the
# family (which is how classify_unsupported_lm_class() decides a class
# is supported at all), while `methods("as_regression_frame")` -- which
# the unsupported-class error tells the USER to run -- starts warning
# "appears not to be S3 generic". Measured, not assumed: with the shim
# in place every supported model was rejected as unsupported. So the
# generic stays a textbook generic and the boundary sits around it.
#
# What this site catches that new_regression_frame() cannot: a frame
# that never passed through the constructor at all -- a hand-built one,
# or one from an `as_regression_frame()` method registered outside this
# package -- and the final, post-mutation state of the methods that keep
# editing their frame after construction.
#
# Measured cost: ~345 us per call on a typical lm frame (9 coef rows),
# ~330 us on a 31-row glm frame -- flat in nrow(coefs), because the work
# is ~30 column and field checks, not a row scan. One
# table_regression(lm) call is ~90 ms, so the whole validation budget is
# well under 1% of a table.

# Phase 7c19: LR test vs no-random-effects model.
#
# Stata `mixed` / `melogit` / `mepoisson` print a single line at the
# bottom of the output:
#
#   LR test vs. linear regression: chibar2(01) = 121.07
#                                Prob >= chibar2 = 0.0000
#
# It answers the publication-substantive question "are the random
# effects needed at all?" The statistic is
#
#   LRT = 2 * ( logLik(fit_full) - logLik(fit_null) )
#
# where fit_null is an `lm` / `glm` / `gls` fit on the same data
# without any random effects. The p-value uses the chi-bar-squared
# correction (Self & Liang 1987):
#
#   p_chibar2 = 0.5 * P( chi^2_q > LRT ),   LRT > 0
#   p_chibar2 = 1                           LRT = 0 (point mass)
#
# where q = number of free parameters in the random structure
# (variances + covariances per grouping factor). The factor 0.5
# accounts for the point mass at the boundary 0; this pragmatic
# halved-chi2(q) covers the joint several-parameter case without
# invoking the multi-component Stram-Lee (1994) mixture. (Stata's
# `mixed` halves only the single-parameter chibar2(01) case and
# prints the UN-halved chi2 with a "conservative" caveat for joint
# tests -- the halving here is spicy's own extension, not Stata's
# joint convention.) At a zero statistic the p-value is 1: half the
# null distribution is the point mass AT zero, so P(chibar2 >= 0)
# = 1 -- matching Stata's boundary output "Prob >= chibar2 = 1.0000".
#
# Returns a list(chi2, df, p_chibar2, family_label) or NULL when
# computation isn't possible (refit error, lme4 unavailable, etc.).
#
# lme4 / glmmTMB / nlme::lme are handled via engine dispatch.
#
# LIKELIHOOD CONVENTION (2026-07-09, dev/re_lrt_ml_reml_finding.md):
# the test follows the FIT'S OWN estimator, matching
# lmerTest::ranova(), Stata mixed, and RLRsim. A Gaussian REML fit is
# compared on the REML likelihood to the fixed-effects-only model's
# REML likelihood (nlme::gls(method = "REML") -- nlme is a
# recommended package); ML fits (and glmer, always ML) compare on ML
# vs lm/glm as before. REML-LRT between models with identical fixed
# effects and nested random structures is valid (Morrell 1998).
# Previously REML fits were auto-refit with ML, which made the
# "(REML)" footer label describe the fit but not the statistic, and
# broke reproduction against ranova.
#
# REML log-likelihood of the fixed-effects-only Gaussian null model,
# via nlme::gls(method = "REML") on the same data. Prior weights (when
# the mixed fit carried any) enter as a fixed variance function --
# Var(e_i) = sigma^2 / w_i, i.e. varFixed(~ 1/w) -- which reproduces
# both lmerTest::ranova()'s weighted null and logLik(lm(w), REML=TRUE)
# exactly (cross-checked 2026-07-09). Returns NA_real_ when gls is
# unavailable or fails -- callers then return NULL (no LRT line)
