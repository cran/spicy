# as_regression_frame() methods for survey::svycoxph() fits and their
# replicate-weight sibling svrepcoxph.
#
# A design-based Cox table is not a coxph table with a different vcov:
# the coefficients come from a design-weighted partial likelihood, the
# variance from the design, and there is no likelihood -- so no AIC, no
# BIC, no logLik, no Cox-Snell R2. The canonical omnibus test is
# survey::regTermTest(), not the three likelihood-ratio tests a coxph
# footer reports. Hence siblings of the coxph extractors rather than a
# detour through them, for three reasons that are all measurable:
#
#   * .coxph_info() calls stats::AIC(), BIC() and logLik() bare. On this
#     class AIC() stops with "No AIC for survey models" (and on
#     svrepcoxph with .NotYetImplemented), while logLik() SUCCEEDS on
#     svrepcoxph and returns NA (df = 3). Three engines, three answers,
#     none of them an information criterion.
#   * survey's summary.svycoxph is
#       function(object, ...) { print(object$survey.design, ...); NextMethod() }
#     -- it PRINTS the design on every call, including when only one
#     field is read (`summary(fit)$rsq` prints before returning
#     numeric(0)). The coxph path calls it twice. Nothing below calls it
#     at all: every quantity is read off the fit.
#   * deviance() returns -184.90 on the linearised engine and 0 on the
#     replicate one (survey's deviance.svycoxph reads `object$ll`, which
#     the replicate engine never sets, and falls through to `else 0`).
#     A zero is more dangerous than a negative: it looks like a result.
#
# Degrees of freedom: survey writes them under degf.resid on one engine
# and degf.residual on the other; `.design_model_df()` reads both with
# `[[`, because `degf.resid` is a unique PREFIX of `degf.residual` and
# `$` silently partial-matches. Inference is Wald-t at that value
# (decision 30), so the p-values are recomputed rather than read from
# summary(), whose column is a z.

# Absolute survival estimands (RMST difference, risk difference) under a
# sampling design: refused, with the cause named and a route out.
#
# The estimand is not what is wrong -- the RMST and risk-difference
# columns were validated against exact adjustedCurves /
# riskRegression oracles. Two OTHER things break, and only the second
# is about inference.
#
# 1. The g-computation does not run on this class at all.
#    `.coxph_baseline()` calls survival::basehaz(), basehaz() goes
#    through survfit(), and survey's method for the class is
#
#      survfit.svycoxph <- function(formula, ...)
#        stop("No survfit method for survey models")
#
#    so the baseline step stops before computing anything (measured on
#    survey 4.5: "No survfit method for survey models"). The route out
#    is to declass the fit to plain `coxph` for the baseline, which
#    does run -- a path of its own, not a component swap.
#
# 2. The inference breaks separately. `.survival_estimand_rows()`
#    resamples SUBJECTS, and a row bootstrap ignores the strata and
#    clusters the design declares. What that costs is
#    design-dependent, not a constant: over five designs and three
#    data seeds, a between-cluster contrast is understated by roughly
#    1.5x to 6x, ordered by cluster count and cluster size, while a
#    within-cluster contrast and a zero-ICC control both sit at ~1x.
#    And it is not specific to these columns: the estimand-level
#    ratios track the coefficient-level ones design by design. This is
#    the ordinary Cox design effect transported onto the estimand.
#
# The design's own replication (as.svrepdesign() / withReplicates())
# is what replaces the row bootstrap.
