# ---- Per-pair rms computation --------------------------------------------

# rms fits compare through rms::lrtest(), the package's own two-model
# likelihood-ratio test, for every class in the family: ols, lrm, cph,
# Glm, psm, orm.
#
# They had to be routed away from BOTH generic paths, because they fit
# both of them wrongly. anova.rms is a single-fit Wald test, not a model
# comparison: handed two fits it aborts ("factor names not in design:
# ..."). Since an anova method DOES exist for class "rms",
# nested_lrt_anova() read that -- correctly, by its own rule -- as an
# engine refusing to compare, so an lrm or cph hierarchy hard-errored
# and the relayed sentence quoted a spicy internal name (register
# n. 246(d), n. 246(f)). ols went the other way: it carries "lm", rode
# the least-squares path, and the same abort was caught there and turned
# into an all-NA row -- a table with no change rows at all.
#
# rms::lrtest() reads each fit's own "Model L.R." and "d.f." off
# fit$stats, the likelihood-ratio machinery every rms class already
# carries. On lrm and cph it returns exactly what the generic logLik
# fallback computes (pinned as an oracle in the tests, to the last
# digit); ols is the class that gains a comparison it never had.
#
# Two corrections are applied to its answer.
#
# DIRECTION. lrtest() takes abs() of BOTH the statistic and the degrees
# of freedom, so a pair handed over the wrong way round comes back as a
# positive chi-square carrying a significant p -- a direction that did
# not happen. Reading the parameter count alone does not catch it: a
# pair that ADDS parameters while fitting WORSE (a REPLACED predictor
# rather than an added one) increases the df and so passes that test,
# and abs() then publishes the degradation as a highly significant
# improvement. Measured on lrm(yb ~ x1) against lrm(yb ~ x2 + x3):
# DeltaChi2 +46.65 with p 8.5e-12, beside a DeltaAIC of +48.65. The
# SIGNED likelihood difference is rebuilt from the two fits' own
# logLik() methods -- every class in the family has one -- and it, not
# rms's absolute value, is what the shared admissibility rule reads.
# Zero passes: two identical fits are a chi-square of 0, not a
# direction.
#
# P-VALUE. lrtest() ends with `1 - pchisq(chisq, dof)`, which cancels to
# exactly 0 once p drops below ~1e-16 -- the ordinary case for a nested
# hierarchy with a real effect. The statistic and the degrees of freedom
# are rms's, exact to the last digit; the p-value is recomputed from
# them on the upper tail, because a p of 0 is not a p and it travels
# into as_structured() and every numeric extraction.
#
# rms's own warnings (psm scale parameters) are left to reach the user:
# an engine's caveat about the comparison it is performing is part of
# the answer. (With rms 8.1.1 that particular branch is not reachable --
# fit$parms is length 0 for weibull and for exponential alike -- so it
# is a policy about relaying warnings, not a described behaviour.)
#

# the comparison reported IS the likelihood-ratio chi-square, and
