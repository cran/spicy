# Structured (typed) view of the regression body.
#
# Layer 3.5: produces a numeric body that parallels the character body
# returned by render_regression_table(). Engines (Excel, gt, tinytable,
# flextable) consume this structured view directly instead of re-
# parsing the character body. This eliminates the duplicated
# string-to-numeric round-trip and gives each engine clean access to
# raw values + per-cell markers + format spec.
#
# The structured body is attached to render_regression_table()'s
# return value as `attr(body, "structured")`. The character body
# (primary return) is unchanged for backward compatibility with
# print() / clipboard / current test snapshots.
#
# The DESCRIPTIVE families (table_categorical / table_continuous /
# table_continuous_lm) attach the same view under the same attribute,
# built by R/tables_structured.R. The schema below is normative for
# them too; only the `token` vocabulary and the set of row roles a
# family emits differ.
