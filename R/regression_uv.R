# Univariable screening tables -- the gtsummary::tbl_uvregression
# equivalent (spec: dev/uvregression_spec.md, fully validated
# 2026-07-09). One model per candidate predictor, all rendered as one
# table (one row block per predictor), optionally merged side by side
# with the full multivariable model under "Univariable" /
# "Multivariable" spanners -- the signature layout of applied
# epidemiology (EpiRHandbook, regression chapter).
#
# Architecture: table_regression_uv() is a thin wrapper. It fits the
# models, wraps the univariable fits in a `spicy_uv_screen` bundle, and
# hands `list(Univariable = bundle, Multivariable = fit)` to
# table_regression() -- the bundle's as_regression_frame() method
# builds ONE composite frame whose coefs are the per-predictor blocks
# of the individual univariable frames. Everything else (title, footers,
# central exponentiation, p_adjust across the screen as ONE family,
# robust vcov per underlying fit, every output engine, tidy()) is the
# ordinary multi-model machinery.

#' Univariable screening table (with optional multivariable merge)
#'
#' Fits one model per candidate predictor (the *univariable screen*)
#' and renders them as a single table with one row block per
#' predictor. With `multivariable = TRUE` (default), the full model
#' containing all predictors is merged side by side under
#' `"Univariable"` / `"Multivariable"` column groups -- the standard
#' presentation of applied epidemiology (the
#' `gtsummary::tbl_uvregression()` + `tbl_merge()` workflow).
#'
#' @details
#' # Sample sizes
#' By default each univariable model is fit on its **own complete
#' cases**, so N varies across predictors -- that is what the `N`
#' column discloses (shown on the first row of each block), and a
#' table note states it whenever the Ns differ. The multivariable
#' model is fit on the complete cases of **all** its variables (its
#' `n` appears in the fit-statistics rows). Pass
#' `complete_cases = TRUE` to restrict every model -- univariable and
#' multivariable -- to the common complete-case sample.
#'
#' # Variance explained
#' `show_columns = c("n", "b", "ci", "p", "r2")` adds an
#' \eqn{R^2}{R^2} column to the screen (`method = "lm"`): each
#' predictor block reports its **own** model's \eqn{R^2}{R^2}, on the
#' first row of the block like `N`. It answers what a coefficient and
#' its interval cannot -- how much of the outcome the predictor
#' accounts for -- and often shows that a firmly established
#' association still explains a small share of the variance. Add
#' `"adj_r2"` for the adjusted form. On the multivariable side the
#' \eqn{R^2}{R^2} is one number for the whole model, so it stays in
#' the fit-statistics rows (where it is shown by default) instead of
#' being repeated down a column. Not available for `method = "glm"`
#' or `"coxph"`: outside least squares only competing
#' pseudo-\eqn{R^2}{R^2} measures exist, and spicy asks you to name
#' the one you want (`show_fit_stats = "pseudo_r2_mcfadden"`).
#'
#' # Multiplicity
#' `p_adjust` (passed through to [table_regression()]) treats the
#' whole univariable screen as ONE family (all screened coefficients
#' together); the multivariable model is its own family, as in any
#' multi-model table.
#'
#' # Why the default screen is linear
#' The default `method = "lm"` fits the linear screen: R's canonical
#' model, and -- when the outcome is continuous -- the estimand with
#' the most direct reading. If the outcome looks binary under this
#' default, the screen proceeds as a linear probability model and
#' says so in a classed warning: LPM coefficients are probability
#' differences, comparable across models and samples in a way that
#' odds ratios are not (Mood, 2010), but the model's built-in
#' heteroskedasticity calls for `vcov = "HC3"`. A two-level factor
#' (or logical) outcome is coded 0/1 on its second level -- the glm
#' convention -- and the warning names the modeled probability; an
#' outcome with more observed levels is refused (a multinomial
#' outcome has no linear screen). The classical
#' epidemiological screen is one argument away: `method = "glm"`
#' (with the default `family = binomial()`) gives the logistic
#' screen, and supplying any `family` selects the glm screen
#' directly.
#'
#' # Intercepts
#' Hidden by default on both sides (each univariable fit has its own
#' nuisance intercept), matching `gtsummary::tbl_regression()`'s
#' `intercept = FALSE` default. Pass `show_intercept = TRUE` to
#' display them: each univariable block then opens with its own fit's
#' `(Intercept)` row, and the multivariable model shows its intercept
#' as in any [table_regression()] table.
#'
#' @param data A data frame.
#' @param outcome The outcome column (unquoted name, tidyselect). For
#'   `method = "coxph"`, a `Surv(time, status)` expression evaluated
#'   in `data` (the `tbl_uvregression` convention).
#' @param predictors Candidate predictor columns (tidyselect, e.g.
#'   `c(age, sex, education)` or `where(is.numeric)`). The outcome
#'   column(s) are dropped from the selection automatically.
#' @param method `"lm"` (default), `"glm"`, or `"coxph"` (requires
#'   the `survival` package; estimates render as HRs with
#'   `exponentiate = TRUE`).
#' @param family A [stats::family] for `method = "glm"`, in any of
#'   the three forms [stats::glm()] accepts: a family object
#'   (`binomial()`), its name (`"binomial"`), or the bare constructor
#'   (`binomial`).
#'   Default `binomial()`, so `method = "glm"` alone is the logistic
#'   screen; supplying `family` without `method` selects the glm
#'   screen directly (a family can only mean that). Refused for
#'   `method = "coxph"`, and
#'   `gaussian()` with the identity link is refused too: use
#'   `method = "lm"` for the linear screen. With `method = "lm"`,
#'   any non-gaussian `family` is refused the same way (use
#'   `method = "glm"`), and a supplied `gaussian()` is ignored with
#'   a classed warning -- the linear screen already fits it.
#' @param multivariable Logical, default `TRUE`: merge the full model
#'   (all predictors together) as a second column group.
#' @param complete_cases Logical, default `FALSE`. `TRUE` restricts
#'   ALL models to the rows complete on outcome + every predictor
#'   (common-sample comparison); the reduction is disclosed in the
#'   table note.
#' @param show_columns Passed to [table_regression()]. Default
#'   `c("n", "b", "ci", "p")` -- the `tbl_uvregression` column set;
#'   `"n"` is the per-predictor sample size. The multivariable group
#'   carries no `N` column (its single `n` is a fit-statistics row,
#'   as in the reference layouts). For binary outcomes, add
#'   `"n_events"` for outcome event counts as `events/N` per factor
#'   level (each column group counts on its own estimation sample).
#'   For `method = "lm"`, add `"r2"` (and/or `"adj_r2"`) for the
#'   share of outcome variance each predictor explains **on its
#'   own** -- see *Variance explained* below.
#'   For `method = "coxph"`, the RMST / risk-difference families
#'   (`"rmst"`, `"risk_diff"`, ...) work with an explicit numeric
#'   `tau` / `at_time` shared by every column: each univariable fit
#'   runs its own `boot_n`-replicate bootstrap, and the multivariable
#'   group reports the covariate-adjusted estimand from the full fit.
#'   `tau = "minmax"` is refused (per-fit horizons would make the
#'   column incomparable across predictors).
#' @param show_intercept Display the `(Intercept)` rows? Default
#'   `FALSE` -- the opposite of [table_regression()]'s default,
#'   because each univariable fit carries its own nuisance intercept.
#'   See *Intercepts*.
#' @param title Table title; `NULL` (default) builds
#'   `"Univariable and multivariable <type> regression: <outcome>"`.
#' @param ... Passed to [table_regression()] (`exponentiate`, `vcov`,
#'   `cluster`, `p_adjust`, `digits`, `labels`, `output`, ...).
#'   `nested` is not
#'   meaningful for a screen and is refused. `cluster` must be a
#'   single vector with one value per row of `data`; it is aligned to
#'   each fit's own estimation sample automatically.
#'
#' @return See [table_regression()] (same output contract).
