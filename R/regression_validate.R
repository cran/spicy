# Decision 41, acted here once for the whole validation layer. This
# function -- and every validator table_regression() calls before its
# frame loop: validate_nested_alignment(), validate_show_columns(),
# validate_class_appropriate_tokens() -- sniffs the FIT with
# inherits(). That is legitimate, and it is not a gap left by the frame
# refactor: these checks exist precisely so that a request a class
# cannot honour dies before any fitting-adjacent work starts (C2
# increment 1, fail fast). A frame flag cannot govern a check that runs
# BEFORE the frame exists, so asking these sites to read one would mean
# building the frames first and losing the fail-fast they were written
# for.
#
# The rule the two layers split on:
#
#   * PRE-frame  -- inherits() on the fit. Refuses the impossible
#                   before any frame is built. Keeps its class-specific
#                   message (the GEE / QIC hint, the rq tau guard, the
#                   lm-vs-glm partial substitutions).
#   * POST-frame -- `info$supports$*` on the built frame, and nothing
#                   else. The AME guard, the partial-effect-size guard
#                   and the nested-comparison guard in
#                   table_regression() all read a declaration; a
#                   builder that mis-declares changes what the table
#                   does, which is what makes the declaration worth
#                   trusting.
#
# So `supports` is the truth about what a frame CAN render, never a
# substitute for the earlier refusal, and nothing below should be
# rewritten to consult it.
