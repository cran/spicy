# Standardized mean differences -- the Table 1 balance diagnostic.
#
# CONVENTION: Austin (2009, Stat Med 28:3083-3107; 2011, Multivar Behav
# Res 46:399-424) for a continuous variable, Yang & Dalton (2012, SAS
# Global Forum 335-2012) for a categorical one:
#
#   continuous   SMD = (m1 - m2) / sqrt((v1 + v2) / 2)
#   binary       SMD = (p1 - p2) / sqrt((p1(1-p1) + p2(1-p2)) / 2)
#   k levels     SMD = sqrt(T' S^- T), T = (P1 - P2)[-1],
#                      S = (V(P1) + V(P2))[-1, -1] / 2,
#                      V(P)_ii = p_i(1 - p_i), V(P)_ij = -p_i p_j
#
# The continuous denominator is the root MEAN of the two GROUP variances
# (each at n - 1), NOT the degrees-of-freedom pooled SD. Measured, at
# equal group sizes the two denominators are the same and the SMD IS
# Cohen's d, `identical()`; at unequal sizes they part (-0.510 vs -0.538
# on the pinned 4-versus-3 fixture). `effect_size = "hedges_g"` is a
# third number again: it applies the J correction on top of d, so it
# NEVER equals the SMD -- the ratio g / SMD is exactly J at equal n
# (0.800 at n = 3 per group, 0.958 at n = 10, verified to 1e-12), and
# converges to 1 only asymptotically. The binary denominator is the
# Bernoulli variance p(1-p), at n, never `var()` at n - 1 (19% apart on
# the pinned example). Triangulated 2026-08-19 against tableone 0.13.2
# (`ExtractSmd`) and cobalt 4.6.3 (`col_w_smd`), which agree with every
# value below to the seventeenth digit; the weighted arm is the
# frequency convention of decision 17 and reproduces the SMD of the
# expanded data exactly, on all three kernels.
#
# ESTIMATOR-PARAMETERIZED ON PURPOSE (decision 28). The kernels take
# ESTIMATES, never data: means, variances, proportion vectors. The base
# families feed them `mean()` / `stats::sd()` / `.wtd_mean()` /
# `.wtd_sd()` / `prop.table()` through the adapters at the bottom of
# this file; the future `table_*_svy()` twins will feed them
# `svymean()` / `svyvar()` without touching a line of the algebra.
#
# NO INTERVAL, EVER (decision 29-A). The SMD is a descriptive balance
# diagnostic; attaching a p or a CI to it reintroduces the test
# reasoning the balance literature asks the reader to drop.

# ---- undefined-value protocol ----------------------------------------------

# caller can word its own disclosure without re-deriving the geometry.
# A kernel that has nothing to estimate (a group of one observation, a
# group whose weights sum to <= 1) returns a bare NA and says nothing:
# the neighbouring SD cell already discloses it.

# pseudo-inverse returns exactly the value the phantom level's absence
# would give. That only holds because T lies in the image of S -- which
# is NOT a general property of `ginv()`, so it is TESTED before the
# value is published:
#
#   * Two groups constant on DIFFERENT levels: S = 0, `ginv(0) = 0`, and
#     the bare route publishes 0 -- "perfectly balanced" for the most
#     imbalanced variable there can be. tableone guards this one
#     (`all(S == 0)` in `StdDiffFromLstMeans`) and returns NaN.
#   * Two profiles on DISJOINT supports: S is singular but not zero, so
#     `all(S == 0)` never fires, and both the bare route AND tableone
#     publish a finite number (sqrt(2) on the pinned k = 4 case) where
#     the true distance is infinite -- ridge regularisation
#     `solve(S + eI)` diverges as e^(-1/2), verified.
#
# One consistency test, `T in image(S)`, covers both and fires on
# nothing else. It can only fail when the two supports are disjoint: if
# they share a level, every null direction of S is constant on the union
# of the supports, and T sums to zero there.
