# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Journal styles, and the typography a language brings with it
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A style is DATA: a named list of format levers (`spicy_style()`), and a
# registry that maps a theme name to one such list plus its provenance
# (journal, source document, URL, consultation date, and the exact list of
# encoded rules). Adding a journal is one registry entry plus one test --
# no new mechanism.
#
# Two kinds of lever live in a style:
#
#   * levers that SHADOW a formal of a table function (`digits`,
#     `p_digits`, `decimal_mark`, `stars`, ...). The style only changes
#     the DEFAULT: an argument the user typed always wins, detected via
#     `match.call()` (which expands partial matches), so passing the
#     default value explicitly still wins.
#   * levers with NO formal (`p_style`, `p_floor`, `p_bands`,
#     `p_sigfig`, `ci_sep`, `ci_brackets`). These reach the low-level
#     formatters through a call-scoped context (pushed on entry, popped
#     by `on.exit()`), so they behave exactly like an argument passed
#     down the call stack -- never like a global setting.
#
# Provenance rule (Amal, 2026-08-14): a named theme enters spicy only
# SOURCED. Every rule below is traceable to a sentence of an official
# document of the institution, recorded in `dev/journal_styles_sources.md`
# with URL and consultation date. Rules the catalogue records as NOT
# FOUND are never invented: the theme inherits the spicy default and the
# documentation says so.

# ---- Constructor ----------------------------------------------------------

#' Build or select a table style
#'
#' A *style* is a small set of number-formatting rules -- how many
#' decimals a p-value gets, where it bottoms out, whether it keeps its
#' leading zero, what the decimal mark is, how a confidence interval is
#' written. `spicy_style()` composes one by hand; the named themes
#' (`"jama"`, `"nejm"`, `"lancet"`, `"annals"`, `"apa"`, `"aer"` --
#' `spicy_style_names()` returns the list) are pre-composed ones, each
#' encoding rules taken verbatim from an official document of the
#' institution.
#'
#' A style is accepted by the `style` argument of [table_regression()],
#' [table_categorical()], [table_continuous()] and
#' [table_continuous_lm()], either as a theme name or as the object
#' returned here, and by `options(spicy.style = )` for document-wide
#' scope.
#'
#' # What a theme claims, and what it does not
#'
#' A theme covers **numeric formatting conformity only** -- not full
#' editorial conformity. It does not check reporting guidelines, table
#' structure, footnote symbols, units, abbreviation policy, or anything
#' else a journal's instructions ask of a manuscript. Each theme below
#' lists the exact rules it encodes, with the sentence it encodes them
#' from; anything not listed is spicy's own default, not the journal's
#' rule.
#'
#' Themes only move **defaults**. An argument you type wins over the
#' theme, always: `table_regression(fit, style = "lancet", digits = 3)`
#' is a Lancet table with three decimals. One consequence worth
#' stating: typing `p_digits` is a request for that many decimals on
#' every p-value, so it also switches off the theme's own ways of
#' choosing p-precision -- `p_bands`, `p_sigfig`, and the `p_floor`
#' derived from them. The leading-zero rule is orthogonal and stays.
#'
#' # Resolution order
#'
#' An argument you type, then the `style` argument, then
#' `getOption("spicy.style")`, then the typography of
#' `getOption("spicy.language")`, then spicy's defaults. Within a
#' style, an explicit function argument beats the style's value for
#' the same lever.
#'
#' # The language's locale
#'
#' A language brings its typography with it, at the bottom of that
#' order. `options(spicy.language = "fr")` is therefore one gesture
#' for a coherent French report table -- French words, and numbers
#' written the French way: comma decimal mark, and the leading zero
#' French typography keeps on a p-value (`0,003`). "La virgule est
#' utilisee pour separer les unites des decimales" (European Union,
#' *Code de redaction interinstitutionnel*, French edition 2022,
#' point 6.5, `https://style-guide.europa.eu/fr`); "Si le nombre se
#' situe entre +1 et -1, le separateur decimal est toujours precede
#' d'un zero" (BIPM, *Le Systeme international d'unites*, 9th
#' edition, 2019, section 5.4.4,
#' `https://www.bipm.org/documents/20126/41483022/SI-Brochure-9.pdf`).
#' `"en"` brings no locale, and nothing changes for anyone who sets
#' no language. The locale reaches the exploration pair as well:
#' `freq()` and `cross_tab()` have no style layer, so the language
#' sets the DEFAULT of their `decimal_mark` and nothing else. An
#' argument you type still wins. The leading zero of a p-value works
#' the same way in both worlds: its DEFAULT follows the mark -- a
#' comma keeps it (`0,003`), a point drops it (`.003`) -- and
#' `p_style` is the explicit lever that overrides that default
#' wherever there is one, which is why a theme's rule survives any
#' mark in the `table_*()` families while the pair, having no such
#' lever, always follows its mark.
#'
#' A theme composes with a locale rather than fighting it, because a
#' theme encodes only what its own source states: `"jama"` fixes no
#' decimal mark, so JAMA under a French language gives JAMA's p-value
#' rules and the French comma. Where the two do meet, the theme wins --
#' you asked for it by name. `"lancet"` keeps its midline decimal
#' point; `"apa"` keeps its missing leading zero, which under a comma
#' prints `,003`, a form the SI brochure forbids. That is the price of
#' an explicit gesture; to keep APA's other rules and restore the
#' zero, compose the way out yourself:
#' `style = spicy_style("apa", p_style = "standard")`. One lever bends
#' the other way: a theme's `", "` interval separator was sourced
#' under a dot mark, and under a comma mark it would BE the mark -- so
#' it yields to the derived `"; "`, exactly as the French adaptations
#' of APA style themselves write (`[3,45; 6,78]`). Any other
#' separator (`" to "`, an en dash) is unambiguous and stays.
#'
#' An argument beats both, which is the escape hatch for a bilingual
#' table: `decimal_mark = "."` under a French language gives French
#' words and a decimal point. It moves only the mark: the p-value
#' keeps the locale's leading zero (`0.003`), because `p_style` is a
#' style lever with no argument of its own --
#' `style = spicy_style(p_style = "apa")` drops it again.
#'
#' See [spicy_labels()] for the language option itself.

#' ## `"jama"` -- JAMA / JAMA Network
#'
#' Source: *Instructions for Table Creation*, JAMA Network author
#' document, 23 February 2016
#' (`https://jamanetwork.com/DocumentLibrary/InstructionsForAuthors/InstructionsForTableCreation.pdf`),
#' consulted 2026-08-14.
#'
#' Encoded:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item p-values on two decimals, three below `.01`, floored at
#'     `<.001`, with no leading zero -- "All P values should be
#'     reported to exact numbers to 2 digits past the decimal point,
#'     regardless of statistical significance. For values lower than
#'     .01, present the P value to 3 digits. Express any values lower
#'     than .001 as P<.001."
#' }
#'
#' Not encoded: everything else in that document (percentages carrying
#' their numerator and denominator, one datum per cell, footnote
#' letters, SI conversion factors) is table *construction*, not number
#' formatting. The document states no rule for the confidence-interval
#' separator or the decimal mark, so spicy's defaults apply.
#'
#' ## `"nejm"` -- The New England Journal of Medicine
#'
#' Source: NEJM Author Center, *New Manuscripts*, section *Statistical
#' Reporting Guidelines*
#' (`https://www.nejm.org/author-center/new-manuscripts`), a living
#' page; its full text was read in a browser by the package maintainer
#' on 2026-08-14 -- the site refuses automated retrieval, which is why
#' earlier surveys reported these rules as unavailable.
#'
#' Encoded:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item tiered p-values, leading zero kept -- "In general, P values
#'     larger than 0.01 should be reported to two decimal places, and
#'     those between 0.01 and 0.001 to three decimal places; P values
#'     smaller than 0.001 should be reported as P<0.001." The
#'     guideline's own text writes `0.01` / `0.001`: unlike JAMA, the
#'     leading zero stays.
#'   \item measures of association on two decimals -- "measures of
#'     association, such as odds ratios, should ordinarily be reported
#'     to two decimal places" (a pin of spicy's default).
#' }
#'
#' Not encoded: the guideline's stated exceptions to the p rule
#' (stopping-rule tests, genomewide studies) are analysis contexts the
#' style layer cannot see; its inference policy (no p-values without a
#' prespecified multiplicity plan, estimates + 95% CI instead, no
#' p-values in the Table 1 of a randomised trial) is about what to
#' report, not how to format it -- request those layouts through
#' `show_columns` and `p_value = FALSE` where you need them.
#'
#' ## `"lancet"` -- The Lancet
#'
#' Sources: *Information for Authors*, April 2026; *Randomised trials
#' in The Lancet: formatting guidelines* and *Observational studies in
#' The Lancet: formatting guidelines*, both last updated July 2025
#' (`https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/authors/tl-info-for-authors-1690986041530.pdf`),
#' consulted 2026-08-14.
#'
#' Below, the journal's midline decimal point (Unicode U+00B7, MIDDLE
#' DOT) is written `[.]` so it cannot be confused with an ordinary
#' full stop.
#'
#' Encoded:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item midline decimal mark, U+00B7, on every number in the table
#'     -- "Type decimal points midline (ie, 23`[.]`4, not 23.4)."
#'   \item p-values on two significant figures, capped at four
#'     decimals, floored at `p<0[.]0001`, leading zero kept --
#'     "Supply p values to two significant figures (capped at four
#'     decimal places), or p<0`[.]`0001."
#'   \item en dash between the bounds of a confidence interval. **This
#'     one is not a written rule**: the journal states none. It matches
#'     the intervals printed throughout the journal's own model tables
#'     and figures (`0[.]78 (0[.]60-1[.]00)`) and is encoded as
#'     conformity to the journal's published examples, nothing
#'     stronger.
#' }
#'
#' Not encoded: the empty-cell filler, the ban on p-values in a
#' randomised trial's baseline table, and the absolute-rather-than-
#' relative effect rule are content decisions, not number formats.
#'
#' One caveat on the en dash. The journal's examples are ratio
#' measures, whose bounds are positive. On the identity scale a
#' negative lower bound puts a minus sign next to the dash
#' (`[-5.17--2.58]`), which reads badly. The journal states no rule
#' for that case and none is invented here; override the separator
#' when it arises:
#' `spicy_style("lancet", ci_sep = " to ")`.
#'
#' ## `"annals"` -- Annals of Internal Medicine
#'
#' Source: *Information for Authors*, American College of Physicians,
#' document publication date 08/04/2026
#' (`https://www.acpjournals.org/pb-assets/pdf/AnnalsAuthorInfo-1755188286957.pdf`),
#' consulted 2026-08-14.
#'
#' Encoded:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item p-values on three decimals up to 0.20 and two decimals above
#'     it, floored at `P<0.001`, leading zero kept -- "For P values
#'     between 0.001 and 0.20, please report the value to the nearest
#'     thousandth. For P values greater than 0.20, please report the
#'     value to the nearest hundredth. For P values less than 0.001,
#'     report as 'P<0.001.'"
#' }
#'
#' Not encoded: the percentage rule ("Report percentages to one decimal
#' place ... when sample size is \eqn{\ge}{>=} 200", no decimals below
#' 200) is conditional on a per-group sample size that the style layer
#' does not see; set `percent_digits` yourself. The `mean (SD)`
#' notation the journal asks for, and its refusal of `\eqn{\pm}{+/-}`,
#' are already how spicy renders dispersion.
#'
#' ## `"apa"` -- APA Style, 7th edition
#'
#' Sources: *APA Style numbers and statistics guide*, last updated
#' 11 September 2024
#' (`https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/numbers-statistics-guide.pdf`);
#' *Sample tables*, last updated June 2024
#' (`https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures/sample-tables`),
#' both consulted 2026-08-14.
#'
#' Encoded -- and this theme **pins** rather than changes: spicy's
#' defaults already follow the guide, so `style = "apa"` is a promise
#' that a future change of those defaults will not move an
#' APA-formatted table.
#' \itemize{
#'   \item p-values on three decimals, floored at `<.001`, no leading
#'     zero -- "Report exact p values to two or three decimals (e.g.,
#'     p = .006, p = .03)", "report p values less than .001 as
#'     'p < .001.'", and "Do not use a zero before a decimal when the
#'     statistic cannot be greater than 1 (proportion, correlation,
#'     level of statistical significance)."
#'   \item estimates and dispersion on two decimals -- "Report other
#'     means and standard deviations and correlations, proportions,
#'     and inferential statistics (t, F, chi-square) to two decimals."
#'   \item confidence intervals in square brackets, bounds separated by
#'     a comma -- the *Sample tables* page gives
#'     `95% CI [LL, UL]` as one of the two official layouts.
#' }
#'
#' Not encoded: the one-decimal rule for means of integer scales
#' (depends on what the variable measures, which spicy cannot know),
#' and the thousands separator (see *Known gaps* below). Nor the star
#' thresholds. The official correlation and ANOVA sample tables mark
#' `.05` / `.01` / `.001`, which is what `stars = TRUE` gives you --
#' but as spicy's own default, not as anything this theme pins: one
#' `stars` lever carries both the thresholds and the decision to show
#' them, and the APA regression sample table shows none. So the theme
#' sets no `stars`, and `style = "apa"` never switches them on.
#'
#' ## `"aer"` -- American Economic Review / AEA journals
#'
#' Source: *AER Style Guide*, American Economic Association
#' (`https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/aer/style-guide`), consulted
#' 2026-08-14. The Tables section is shared with AEJ: Applied, AEJ:
#' Macro, AEJ: Policy, JEL and AEA P&P.
#'
#' Encoded:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item leading zero on every decimal fraction, p-values included --
#'     "Place a zero in front of the decimal point in all decimal
#'     fractions (e.g., 0.357, not .357)."
#'   \item no significance stars, pinned -- "Do not use asterisks to
#'     denote significance of estimation results. Report the standard
#'     errors in parentheses." This is the only outright written ban on
#'     stars in the whole surveyed corpus, so it is encoded even though
#'     spicy already defaults to `stars = FALSE`. Ask for
#'     `show_columns = c("b", "se")` for the standard-error layout.
#' }
#'
#' Not encoded: the guide fixes no number of decimals, no p-value
#' floor, no interval format and no decimal mark, so spicy's defaults
#' apply. Horizontal-rules-only, no shading, a nine-column maximum and
#' "Panel A / Panel B" blocks are layout, not number formatting.
#'
#' # Known gaps
#'
#' Two rules the sources state but this release does not encode:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item **thousands separator** (APA's comma, the EU code's thin
#'     no-break space). spicy formats numbers through more than one
#'     path, and a separator applied to some of them only would print
#'     `1,234` in one column and `1234` in the next -- the exact
#'     inconsistency the SI brochure forbids ("the format used should
#'     not vary within one column").
#'   \item **significant-figure rounding of estimates** (Epidemiology's
#'     `nn` / `n.n` / `0.nn`, Science's "report only significant
#'     digits"). spicy's `digits` is a decimals contract applied per
#'     column family; a blanket significant-figure mode would also
#'     round fit statistics, which those rules do not ask for.
#' }
#'
#' Journals deliberately absent: **BMJ** (its house-style page could
#' not be read from any official source, and the widely repeated
#' "95% CI 1.2 to 3.4" rule traces to no BMJ document),
#' **Econometrica** (verified negative: the official guidelines contain
#' no numeric table rule), **QJE** (its instructions page could not be
#' read), **Epidemiology** (see *Known gaps*). Naming any of them would
#' mean inventing their rules.
#'
#' @param base Optional theme to start from -- a theme name or another
#'   `spicy_style` -- whose levers the arguments below override. This
#'   is the composition escape hatch: `spicy_style("lancet",
#'   ci_sep = " to ")` is The Lancet's rules with one of them changed.
#'   The theme's provenance travels with the result and names the
#'   levers you overrode, so a modified theme never passes for the
#'   theme itself.
#' @param ... Must be empty. Any argument landing here is a misspelt
#'   lever and raises an error rather than being ignored.
#' @param p_style How p-values carry their leading zero: `"apa"` drops
#'   it (`.003`), `"standard"` keeps it (`0.003`). `NULL` leaves
#'   spicy's default, which follows the mark: dropped under a point,
#'   kept under a comma.
#' @param p_digits Decimal places for p-values (a positive integer).
#'   Under `p_sigfig` it acts as the decimal cap instead.
#' @param p_floor The value below which a p-value prints as `<floor`
#'   rather than exactly, e.g. `0.001` for `<.001`. A number strictly
#'   between 0 and 1. `NULL` uses `10^-p_digits`.
#' @param p_bands Decimal places that vary with the size of the
#'   p-value: a list of two-element numeric vectors
#'   `c(cutoff, digits)`, cutoffs strictly increasing, the last one
#'   `Inf`. `list(c(0.01, 3), c(Inf, 2))` reads as "three decimals
#'   below .01, two otherwise". The comparison is `p < cutoff`.
#'   Mutually exclusive with `p_sigfig`.
#' @param p_sigfig Significant figures for p-values (a positive
#'   integer), capped at `p_digits` decimal places. Mutually exclusive
#'   with `p_bands`.
#' @param decimal_mark A single character; the mark between the integer
#'   and the decimal part of every number in the table.
#' @param ci_sep The string between the two bounds of a confidence
#'   interval. `NULL` keeps spicy's default, which is `", "` and turns
#'   into `"; "` when the decimal mark is a comma.
#' @param ci_brackets A character vector of length two, the opening and
#'   closing delimiters of a confidence interval, e.g. `c("[", "]")` or
#'   `c("(", ")")`.
#' @param stars Significance stars: `FALSE` to suppress them, or a
#'   named numeric vector of symbol-to-threshold pairs such as
#'   `c("***" = .001, "**" = .01, "*" = .05)`.
#' @param digits,effect_size_digits,fit_digits,ic_digits Decimal places
#'   for estimates, effect sizes, fit statistics and information
#'   criteria. Each is applied only by the table functions that have
#'   the matching argument.
#' @param percent_digits,v_digits Decimal places for percentages and
#'   for the association measure of [table_categorical()].
#'
#' @return `spicy_style()` returns an object of class `spicy_style`: a
#'   named list holding only the levers that were set. Themes returned
#'   by name carry a `provenance` attribute with the journal, its
#'   source document and the exact list of encoded rules; `print()`
#'   shows it. `spicy_style_names()` returns the character vector of
