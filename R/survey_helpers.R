# Survey-design support for the descriptive twins.
#
# `table_continuous_svy()` and `table_categorical_svy()` compute no
# design-based statistic of their own: every number they show comes
# from survey (Lumley), which is the package that owns linearisation
# and replicate weights. What lives in this file is the part survey
# does not do -- recognising a design object, reading the handful of
# design facts a table owes its reader, and cutting a domain the one
# way that keeps the variance right.
#
# The one rule the rest of the package must not break: a domain is cut
# with `[` / `subset()` ON THE DESIGN, never by rebuilding a
# `svydesign()` from `design$variables`. Measured on
# `svydesign(id = ~dnum, weights = ~pw, fpc = ~fpc, data = apiclus1)`
# restricted to the first ten clusters:
#
#   subset(dclus1, dom)                SE = 15.402503359507902
#   dclus1$prob[!dom] <- Inf           SE = 15.402503359507902
#   svyby(~api00, ~dom, dclus1)        SE = 15.402503359507902
#   svydesign(data = apiclus1[dom, ])  SE = 15.737900457093147   <- WRONG
#
# The three legitimate routes agree to the bit; the rebuilt design does
# not, because `svydesign()` recomputes `fpc$sampsize` from the rows it
# was handed (10 instead of the original 15).

# The version of survey the delegation map was measured against, and
# the floor `DESCRIPTION` declares. Two independent reasons, both from
# survey's own NEWS for 4.5: `svyciprop(method = "wilson")` is an
# addition of that release, and `svyby(covmat = TRUE)` "now works for
# estimators where subset() doesn't actually drop rows" -- which is
