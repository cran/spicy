# ---- the public function ---------------------------------------------------

#' Categorical summary table from a survey design
#'
#' @description
#' The design twin of [table_categorical()]: counts and estimated
#' percentages of categorical variables computed from a
#' `survey::svydesign()` or `survey::as.svrepdesign()` object instead
#' of a data frame.
#'
#' Every statistic is survey's. `survey::svymean()` estimates the
#' percentages and their design effects, `survey::svyciprop()` their
#' confidence intervals, and `survey::svychisq()` tests the
#' association, Rao-Scott corrected and referred to the design degrees
#' of freedom.
#'
#' @details
#' # What the columns are
#'
#' `n` is the *observed* count -- the number of rows in the sample, not
#' an estimated population size. `%` is the estimated percentage
#' *within* its column: without `by` it is the distribution of the
#' variable in the population, with `by` the distribution inside that
#' domain. The table note gives the sample size and the estimated
#' population together, because neither alone tells the reader what
#' they are looking at.
#'
#' `proportion_ci = TRUE` adds the interval of each percentage.
#' `ci_method` chooses among the seven `survey::svyciprop()` offers;
#' the default `"logit"` is bounded inside 0 to 100, which the Wald
#' interval (`"mean"`) is not. The percentage itself always comes from
#' `survey::svymean()`, so it does not move when `ci_method` does.
#'
#' # The test
#'
#' `svychisq()` with `chisq_statistic = "F"` (the default) is the
#' Pearson chi-square with the Rao-Scott second-order correction,
#' referred to F(ndf, `survey::degf(design)`). It is survey's own
#' default and the one Stata's `svy: tabulate` reports.
#'
#' It runs on the *complete cases* of the two variables, and on their
#' observed levels: a `(Missing)` row and a declared-but-unobserved
#' level are descriptive, and neither belongs to the null hypothesis.
#' The p-value is therefore the same whether `drop_na` shows those rows
#' or removes them, and the intervals beside it describe the same
#' domain -- the two families test the same table.
#'
#' `"Chisq"` shows the p-value only: survey adjusts the statistic in
#' the `"F"` branch and only the p-value in the `"Chisq"` one, so the
#' statistic there is not the one the p-value came from. `"Wald"`,
#' `"adjWald"` and `"saddlepoint"` are available; `"lincom"` and
#' `"wls-score"` are refused, the first because its integration is
#' documented as failing in the far tail (`?pchisqsum`), the second
#' because it has no reporting convention here.
#'
#' # Stability
#'
#' This function is **stabilising** in the sense `?spicy` defines: the
#' names of its design-specific arguments may still be tightened
#' before 1.0 -- with a `NEWS.md` entry -- but the behaviour does not
#' change silently. It was experimental through 0.13; the shape of the
#' table has held across the cycle, so it now moves on the parent
#' family's clock rather than its own. The numbers themselves are
#' survey's and do not move with it.
#'
#' # What is absent, and why
#'
#' `weights` and `rescale` (the weighting *is* the design). `correct`
#' (Yates), `simulate_p` and `simulate_B`, which have no meaning once
#' the reference distribution is Rao-Scott's. And the association
#' measures: Cramer's V, phi, tau-b/c, gamma, Somers' D and lambda
#' have no established design-based variance, and the intervals
#' [table_categorical()] gives them assume simple random sampling. The
#' design-based measure of association here is the Rao-Scott test in
#' the `p` column; for an effect size, model it with
#' `table_regression(survey::svyglm(...))`.
#'
#' @param design A survey design: `survey::svydesign()` or
#'   `survey::as.svrepdesign()`.
#' @param select Columns to tabulate, as a tidyselect expression on the
#'   design's variables.
#' @param by A single grouping column: one column block per level.
#' @param labels Named character vector of display labels.
#' @param levels_keep Levels to keep, as a character vector (all
#'   variables) or a named list (per variable).
#' @param include_total Add a `Total` column block with the whole
#'   design's percentages (default `TRUE`, only with `by`).
#' @param drop_na Drop missing values (default `FALSE`: they show as a
#'   `(Missing)` level). Shown or dropped, they never enter the test:
#'   the p-value is computed on the complete cases either way, which is
#'   the convention [table_categorical()] applies.
#' @param proportion_ci Add the confidence interval of each percentage.
#' @param ci_method Interval method passed to `survey::svyciprop()`:
#'   `"logit"` (default), `"likelihood"`, `"asin"`, `"beta"`,
#'   `"mean"`, `"xlogit"` or `"wilson"`.
#' @param ci_level Coverage of the interval.
#' @param chisq_statistic Statistic for `survey::svychisq()`: `"F"`
#'   (default), `"Chisq"`, `"Wald"`, `"adjWald"` or `"saddlepoint"`.
#'   `"saddlepoint"` is refused on a replicate-weights design: survey
#'   computes its p-value without the denominator degrees of freedom
#'   there, so it comes out too small.
#' @param deff Show the design effect of each percentage: `FALSE`
#'   (default), `TRUE` or `"replace"`.
#' @param df Degrees of freedom for the intervals. `NULL` (default)
#'   uses `survey::degf()` on each domain. It does not reach the test:
#'   `survey::svychisq()` has no `df` argument, so the Rao-Scott
#'   reference distribution keeps the design's own degrees of freedom
#'   and the note says so.
#' @param p_value Show the p-value column (defaults to `TRUE` with
#'   `by`). A variable whose complete cases include negatively weighted
#'   rows is not tested: the Rao-Scott correction is a function of the
#'   design variance, which is not defined when the weights change
#'   sign. Its percentages are still reported, the note says which
#'   tests were withheld, and the call warns
#'   (`spicy_negative_weights_no_test`).
#' @param percent_digits,p_digits,decimal_mark Number formatting.
#' @param align Numeric-cell alignment: `"decimal"`, `"center"` or
#'   `"right"`.
#' @param output One of `"default"`, `"data.frame"`, `"long"`, or a
#'   rendering engine: `"tinytable"`, `"gt"`, `"flextable"`,
#'   `"excel"`, `"clipboard"`, `"word"`. `"data.frame"` and `"long"`
#'   are synonyms here and return the same object: the wide compute
#'   frame, one row per level with a pair of columns per group. Note
#'   the difference from [table_categorical()], where the two tokens
#'   return genuinely different shapes -- this design carries a single
#'   compute frame, and both names reach it.
#' @param indent_text,indent_text_excel_clipboard Level-row
#'   indentation, for the console and for the plain-text engines.
#' @param excel_path,excel_sheet,clipboard_delim,word_path Output
#'   destinations, as in [table_categorical()].
#' @param user_na Honour declared missing values (see `?freq`).
#' @param style A journal style; see [spicy_style()].
#'
#' @return A `spicy_categorical_svy_table`: the wide compute frame,
#'   with the display frame and the typed view attached.
#'   `output = "data.frame"` / `"long"` returns the compute frame
#'   unclassed -- the two tokens are synonyms and return identical
#'   objects.
