#' Continuous-outcome linear-model table
#'
#' @description
#' Builds publication-ready summary tables from a series of linear
#' models for one or many continuous outcomes selected with tidyselect
#' syntax.
#'
#' A single focal predictor is supplied with `by`; each selected numeric
#' outcome is fit as `lm(outcome ~ by, ...)`, optionally extended with
#' additive covariates via `covariates` and case weights via `weights`.
#' Categorical `by` produces model-based estimated marginal means by
#' level (covariate-adjusted via `adjustment` when covariates are
#' present), plus an optional single difference for dichotomous
#' predictors. Numeric `by` produces the slope and its confidence
#' interval.
#'
#' Inference adapts via `vcov`: classical OLS, `"HC0"`-`"HC5"`
#' (heteroscedasticity-consistent), `"CR0"`-`"CR3"` (cluster-robust,
#' requires `cluster`), or `"bootstrap"` / `"jackknife"` resampling.
#' Effect sizes (Cohen's `"d"`, Hedges' `"g"`, Hays' `"omega2"`,
#' Cohen's `"f2"`) are reported with optional noncentral *t* / *F*
#' confidence intervals via `effect_size_ci`, and adapt under
#' covariate adjustment (see `effect_size`).
#'
#' Multiple output formats are available via `output`: a printed ASCII table
#' (`"default"`), a plain wide `data.frame` (`"data.frame"`), a raw long
#' `data.frame` (`"long"`), or rendered outputs (`"tinytable"`, `"gt"`,
#' `"flextable"`, `"excel"`, `"clipboard"`, `"word"`).
#'
#' @param data A `data.frame`.
#' @param select Outcome columns to include. If `regex = FALSE`, use tidyselect
#'   syntax or a character vector of column names (default:
#'   `tidyselect::everything()`). If `regex = TRUE`, provide a regular expression
#'   pattern (character string).
#' @param by A single predictor column. Accepts an unquoted column name or a
#'   single character column name. The predictor can be:
#'   - **numeric** (continuous): treated as a continuous regressor. The
#'     table reports the slope of `by` and its CI from `lm(y ~ by, ...)`.
#'   - **factor** or **ordered factor**: treated as categorical. Level order
#'     is preserved as declared; the **first level** is the reference for
#'     the displayed contrast (R's default treatment-contrast convention).
#'     An ordered factor is refit as an unordered factor with the same
#'     level order, so the model uses treatment contrasts -- not the
#'     polynomial contrasts (`contr.poly`) `lm()` would apply by default.
#'     The ordering only determines the display order and the reference
#'     level; per-level means, the displayed difference, and its CI are
#'     identical to those of an unordered factor with the same levels.
#'   - **character**: coerced to factor with `factor(by)`, which orders the
#'     levels alphabetically. To control the reference level, supply `by`
#'     as an explicit factor with the desired level ordering (e.g. via
#'     [forcats::fct_relevel()] or `factor(..., levels = ...)`).
#'   - **logical**: coerced to factor with levels `"FALSE"`, `"TRUE"` (in
#'     that order, since `FALSE < TRUE`). The reference level is `"FALSE"`,
#'     so a binary contrast displays as `Delta (TRUE - FALSE)`.
#'   - **haven labelled with value labels** (an SPSS / Stata import):
#'     treated as categorical over the raw codes, in ascending code
#'     order (the reference level is the lowest code; the model needs
#'     a fixed level order). [table_continuous()] and
#'     [table_categorical()] form the same groups from such a column
#'     but display them in order of first appearance in the data, so
#'     the group ORDER can differ between the sibling tables. A
#'     labelled vector without value labels is treated as a continuous
#'     regressor. Declared missing values follow `user_na` as usual.
#'
#'   Rows with `NA` in `by` are excluded from the analytic sample for each
#'   outcome (NAs in `y` and `weights` are also excluded; see Details).
#' @param covariates Optional additive covariates to adjust each per-outcome
#'   linear model for. Accepts a tidyselect expression (e.g.
#'   `covariates = c(age, sex)`, `covariates = tidyselect::all_of(cov_vec)`,
#'   `covariates = tidyselect::starts_with("control_")`) or a literal
#'   character vector of column names. Each covariate must be numeric,
#'   integer, logical, factor, or character; covariates that also appear
#'   in `select` are silently auto-excluded from the outcome list (a
#'   variable cannot be both outcome and adjustment), and a covariate
#'   that equals `by` raises an error (a variable cannot be both
#'   predictor and adjustment).
#'
#'   When non-empty, each model is fitted as `lm(y ~ by + cov1 + cov2 + ...)`
#'   and the reported estimate / SE / p-value / CI on `by` are
#'   covariate-adjusted via the focal coefficient. For categorical `by`,
#'   the displayed `emmean` is the covariate-adjusted estimated marginal
#'   mean -- see `adjustment` for the choice of estimand
#'   (G-computation by default vs. equal-weight averaging). The omnibus
#'   test of `by` is the Wald *F* restricted to the focal coefficients
#'   (computed via `sandwich` / `clubSandwich` for HC* / CR* mode), so
#'   adding covariates does not contaminate the omnibus statistic with
#'   covariate contributions. Effect sizes adapt automatically -- see
#'   `effect_size`.
#'
#'   v1 supports additive covariates only. Formula syntax with
#'   interactions or transforms (`covariates = ~ age * sex`,
#'   `covariates = ~ I(age^2)`) is reserved for a future release; passing
#'   a formula raises a `spicy_unsupported` error with a migration hint.
#'
#'   Rows with `NA` in any covariate are dropped from the analytic
#'   sample for each outcome (complete-cases per outcome, matching the
#'   existing `by` / `weights` NA handling).
#' @param adjustment How the covariate-adjusted estimated marginal
#'   means (the `emmean` / `emmean_se` / `emmean_ci_*` columns) are
#'   computed when `covariates` is non-empty. One of:
#'   - `"proportional"` (the default; matches Stata `margins` and
#'     [marginaleffects::avg_predictions()]): G-computation on the
#'     observed sample. For each focal level of `by`, the model
#'     predicts at every observation with `by` set to that level
#'     (covariates kept at their observed values), and the
#'     predictions are averaged. Population-weighted by construction
#'     -- the empirical joint distribution of covariates is the
#'     reference. Under `weights`, the averaging uses the case
#'     weights (the Stata `margins` convention after a weighted
#'     regression; equivalent to
#'     `marginaleffects::avg_predictions(wts = )`), so the reference
#'     distribution is the weighted one. Best when the goal is "what
#'     is the predicted mean in *this* population if everyone had
#'     `by = lvl`".
#'   - `"balanced"` (matches [emmeans::emmeans()] default and the
#'     SPSS UNIANOVA EMMEANS / SAS LSMEANS conventions): synthetic
#'     grid of factor-covariate level combinations x numeric
#'     covariates fixed at their sample mean, with each grid cell
#'     weighted equally. Treats the design as if covariates were
#'     balanced -- the "marginal mean assuming a balanced design"
#'     estimand. Best when the goal is to report a covariate-purified
#'     comparison independent of the empirical covariate distribution.
#'
#'   Both methods reduce to the same linear-contrast formula
#'   `emmean = avg_row %*% beta` and inherit the spicy variance
#'   pipeline (HC* / CR* / bootstrap / jackknife). They give the
#'   same answer when there are no covariates, and also when all
#'   covariates are numeric (fixed at their means either way). The
#'   two estimands diverge when a factor, character, or logical
#'   covariate has non-uniform observed proportions: those are
#'   levels to balance, and `"balanced"` weights them equally
#'   (a logical is a two-level factor to `lm()`, balanced
#'   FALSE/TRUE -- the `emmeans` convention).
#' @param exclude Columns to exclude from `select`. Supports tidyselect syntax
#'   and character vectors of column names.
#' @param regex Logical. If `FALSE` (the default), uses tidyselect helpers. If
#'   `TRUE`, the `select` argument is treated as a regular expression.
#' @param weights Optional case weights. Accepts:
#'   - `NULL` (default): an ordinary unweighted `lm()` is fit.
#'   - an **unquoted numeric column name** present in `data`.
#'   - a **single character column name** present in `data`.
#'   - a **numeric vector of length `nrow(data)`** evaluated in the calling
#'     environment.
#'
#'   Validation: weights must be finite, non-negative, and contain at least
#'   one positive value (otherwise the function errors). Rows with `NA` in
#'   `weights` are excluded from the analytic sample for each outcome,
#'   alongside rows with `NA` in `y` or `by`. When supplied, weights are
#'   passed to `lm(..., weights = ...)`, so coefficients become weighted
#'   least-squares estimates and `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}`, adjusted `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}`, and the four effect
#'   sizes are computed from the corresponding weighted sums of squares
#'   (see the *Weights* section in Details).
#' @param vcov Variance estimator used for standard errors, confidence
#'   intervals, and Wald test statistics. One of:
#'   - `"classical"` (default): the ordinary OLS/WLS variance from
#'     `vcov(lm)`, which assumes homoscedastic errors.
#'   - `"HC0"`: the original Eicker--White heteroskedasticity-consistent
#'     sandwich estimator (White 1980), with no finite-sample correction.
#'   - `"HC1"`: HC0 multiplied by `n / (n - p)` (MacKinnon and White 1985).
#'     Matches Stata's `, robust` default.
#'   - `"HC2"`: residuals divided by `sqrt(1 - h_ii)`
#'     (MacKinnon and White 1985).
#'   - `"HC3"`: residuals divided by `(1 - h_ii)` (MacKinnon and White 1985).
#'     A common default for small to moderate samples (Long and Ervin 2000).
#'   - `"HC4"`: leverage-adaptive variant designed for influential
#'     observations (Cribari-Neto 2004).
#'   - `"HC4m"`: refinement of HC4 with a modified leverage exponent
#'     (Cribari-Neto and da Silva 2011).
#'   - `"HC5"`: alternative leverage-adaptive variant designed for
#'     leveraged data (Cribari-Neto, Souza and Vasconcellos 2007).
#'   - `"CR0"`, `"CR1"`, `"CR2"`, `"CR3"`: cluster-robust sandwich
#'     estimators for non-independent observations (Liang and Zeger
#'     1986); requires `cluster`. `"CR2"` is the modern default
#'     (Bell and McCaffrey 2002; Pustejovsky and Tipton 2018), with
#'     Satterthwaite degrees of freedom for inference; the
#'     fractional df is reported in the `df2` column and in the
#'     `t(df)` / `F(df1, df2)` test header. `"CR1"` applies the
#'     G/(G-1) correction only; Stata's `, vce(cluster id)` uses the
#'     larger G(N-1)/((G-1)(N-p)) factor with t(G-1) inference
#'     (clubSandwich's `"CR1S"`; exposed for `lm` fits in
#'     [table_regression()], not here), so `"CR1"` does
#'     not reproduce Stata. Cluster-robust variants
#'     are dispatched to [clubSandwich::vcovCR()] and inference uses
#'     [clubSandwich::coef_test()] / [clubSandwich::Wald_test()];
#'     install `clubSandwich` to use them.
#'   - `"bootstrap"`: nonparametric (resampling cases) or cluster
#'     bootstrap variance, depending on whether `cluster` is supplied
#'     (Davison and Hinkley 1997; Cameron, Gelbach and Miller 2008).
#'     The number of replicates is set by `boot_n`. Inference is
#'     asymptotic (`z` for single contrasts, `chi^2(q)` for the global
#'     Wald test); CIs are Wald-type around the point estimate.
#'   - `"jackknife"`: leave-one-out variance, or leave-one-cluster-out
#'     when `cluster` is supplied (Quenouille 1956; MacKinnon and White
#'     1985). Inference is asymptotic (`z` / `chi^2(q)`).
#'
#'   The `HC*` variants are computed via [sandwich::vcovHC()].
#'   Coefficients (means, contrasts, slopes), `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}`, and the standardized
#'   effect sizes (`f2`, `d`, `g`, `omega2`) are point estimates from the
#'   OLS/WLS fit and are not affected by `vcov`; only their standard errors,
#'   CIs, and the test statistic of the contrast change.
#' @param cluster Cluster identifier for cluster-aware variance
#'   estimators. Required when `vcov` is one of the `CR*` variants;
#'   optional and triggers a cluster bootstrap or leave-one-cluster-out
#'   jackknife when `vcov` is `"bootstrap"` / `"jackknife"`; forbidden
#'   for the other (independent-observation) variants. Accepts:
#'   - `NULL` (default): no cluster structure.
#'   - an unquoted column name in `data`.
#'   - a single character column name in `data`.
#'   - a one-sided formula naming a column in `data` (`~ region`), the
#'     `sandwich` / `fixest` convention shared with [table_regression()].
#'   - an atomic vector of length `nrow(data)` evaluated in the calling
#'     environment (factor, character, integer, etc.).
#'
#'   Rows with `NA` in `cluster` are excluded from the analytic sample
#'   for each outcome (alongside rows with `NA` in `y`, `by`, or
#'   `weights`). At least two distinct non-missing cluster values are
#'   required. Multi-way clustering (a list / data.frame of multiple
#'   cluster vectors) is not supported; use [sandwich::vcovCL()] or
#'   [clubSandwich::vcovCR()] directly on the fitted model for that case.
#' @param boot_n Integer. Number of bootstrap replicates used when
#'   `vcov = "bootstrap"`. Defaults to `1000`. Ignored otherwise.
#'   Must be at least `50` (values below that floor raise an error:
#'   fewer replicates make the variance estimate too noisy to use);
#'   non-integer values are truncated (e.g. `500.9` becomes `500`).
#'   Larger values reduce Monte-Carlo error in the bootstrap variance;
#'   typical values for inference are `500`-`2000`.
#' @param contrast Contrast display for categorical predictors. One of:
#'   - `"auto"` (default): show a single reference contrast
#'     `Delta (level2 - level1)` only when `by` has exactly two non-empty
#'     levels. The reference level is the **first level of the factor**
#'     (R's default treatment-contrast convention,
#'     `getOption("contrasts")[1]`). To change which level acts as the
#'     reference, re-level `by` upstream (for example with
#'     [forcats::fct_relevel()] or [stats::relevel()]).
#'   - `"none"`: suppress the contrast column for categorical predictors.
#'     Level-specific means are still displayed.
#' @param statistic Logical. If `TRUE`, includes a test-statistic column in the
#'   wide and rendered outputs. Defaults to `FALSE`.
#' @param p_value Logical. If `TRUE`, includes a `p` column in the wide and
#'   rendered outputs. Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param show_n Logical. If `TRUE`, includes an unweighted `n` column in the
#'   wide and rendered outputs. Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param show_weighted_n Logical. If `TRUE` and `weights` is supplied,
#'   includes a `Weighted n` column equal to the sum of case weights in the
#'   analytic sample. Defaults to `FALSE`.
#' @param effect_size Character. Effect-size column to include in the wide and
#'   rendered outputs. One of:
#'   - `"none"` (the default): no effect-size column.
#'   - `"f2"`: Cohen's `\eqn{f^2}{f^2} = \eqn{R^2}{R^2} / (1 - \eqn{R^2}{R^2})`. Defined for any predictor type.
#'     Familiar from Cohen (1988); standard input for a-priori power analysis.
#'     Note that for a single-predictor model, `\eqn{f^2}{f^2}` is a monotone transform of
#'     `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}` and adds no information beyond it.
#'   - `"d"`: Cohen's `d = beta_hat / sigma_hat`, where `beta_hat` is the
#'     model coefficient (the displayed difference) and `sigma_hat` is the
#'     residual standard deviation from the fitted model. Defined only when
#'     `by` has exactly two non-empty levels; otherwise the function errors.
#'     The sign matches the displayed `Delta (level2 - level1)`.
#'   - `"g"`: Hedges' `g = J * d` with the small-sample correction
#'     `J = 1 - 3 / (4 * df_resid - 1)`. Same domain as `"d"`.
#'   - `"omega2"`: Hays' `omega-squared`, a bias-corrected estimator of the
#'     population variance explained, less optimistic than `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}` for small
#'     samples. Defined for any predictor type and truncated at 0.
#'
#'   When `weights` is supplied, `"d"`, `"g"`, and `"omega2"` are derived from
#'   the weighted least-squares fit (using weighted sums of squares and the
#'   model's weighted residual standard deviation), keeping them consistent
#'   with the weighted contrast and its CI shown in the table. All effect
#'   sizes are point estimates derived from the OLS/WLS fit and are **not**
#'   affected by `vcov`.
#'
#'   **Under covariate adjustment** (`covariates` non-empty):
#'   - `"f2"` and `"omega2"` become the **partial** *\eqn{f^2}{f^2}* / partial *\eqn{\omega^2}{omega^2}*,
#'     derived from the partial *F* of `by` (the Type-II test of `by`
#'     after all covariates, equal to [stats::drop1()] in this
#'     additive setting) --
#'     the correctly-defined effect size when the model is adjusted.
#'     For numeric `by`, partial *\eqn{f^2}{f^2}* equals the squared partial
#'     correlation of `by` with the outcome, divided by `(1 - r^2_partial)`.
#'   - `"d"` and `"g"` raise a `spicy_unsupported` error: Cohen's *d*
#'     and Hedges' *g* have no canonical extension to adjusted models
#'     (the pooled SD is undefined under adjustment). Use `"f2"` or
#'     `"omega2"` instead -- both generalise via partial *F*.
#' @param effect_size_ci Logical. If `TRUE` and `effect_size != "none"`, adds
#'   a confidence interval for the effect size derived from inversion of the
#'   appropriate noncentral distribution (noncentral t for `"d"` / `"g"`;
#'   noncentral F for `"omega2"` / `"f2"`). The CI level is taken from
#'   `ci_level`. In the long output (`output = "long"`), the bounds are always
#'   present in `es_ci_lower` / `es_ci_upper` (numeric). In the wide raw
#'   output (`output = "data.frame"`), the bounds appear under the same
#'   names, `es_ci_lower` / `es_ci_upper` (numeric). In the printed ASCII
#'   table and rendered outputs (`"tinytable"`, `"gt"`, `"flextable"`,
#'   `"word"`, `"excel"`, `"clipboard"`), the effect-size column shows the
#'   value followed by the CI in brackets (e.g. `0.18 [0.07, 0.30]`). Defaults
#'   to `FALSE`. When `effect_size = "none"`, this argument is ignored with a
#'   warning.
#' @param r2 Character. Fit statistic to include in the wide and rendered
#'   outputs. One of:
#'   - `"r2"` (default): the model `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}` (`summary(lm)$r.squared`).
#'   - `"adj_r2"`: adjusted `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}`, penalising for `df_effect` relative to the
#'     residual degrees of freedom.
#'   - `"none"`: omit the fit-statistic column.
#'
#'   When `weights` is supplied, `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}` and adjusted `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}` are the weighted
#'   least-squares versions reported by `summary(lm(..., weights = ...))`.
#' @param ci Logical. If `TRUE`, includes contrast confidence-interval columns
#'   in the wide and rendered outputs when a single contrast is shown.
#'   Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param labels An optional named character vector of outcome labels. Names
#'   must match column names in `data`. When `NULL` (the default), labels are
#'   auto-detected from variable attributes; if none are found, the column name
#'   is used.
#' @param ci_level Confidence level for coefficient and model-based mean
#'   intervals (default: `0.95`). Must be between 0 and 1 exclusive.
#' @param digits Number of decimal places for descriptive values, regression
#'   coefficients, and test statistics (default: `2`). Must be a single
#'   non-negative number; non-integer values are truncated (e.g. `2.9`
#'   becomes `2`). Same constraint for `fit_digits` and
#'   `effect_size_digits`.
#' @param fit_digits Number of decimal places for model-fit columns (`\eqn{R^2}{R^2}` or
#'   adjusted `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}`) in wide and rendered outputs (default: `2`).
#' @param effect_size_digits Number of decimal places for the effect-size
#'   column (`f2`, `d`, `g`, or `omega2`) in wide and rendered outputs
#'   (default: `2`).
#' @param p_digits Integer >= 1. Number of decimal places used to render
#'   *p*-values in the `p` column (default: `3`, the APA Publication
#'   Manual standard). Both the displayed precision and the
#'   small-*p* threshold derive from this argument: `p_digits = 3`
#'   prints `.045` and `<.001`; `p_digits = 4` prints `.0451` and
#'   `<.0001`; `p_digits = 2` prints `.05` and `<.01`. Useful for
#'   genomics / GWAS contexts where adjusted *p*-values can be very
#'   small, or for journals using a coarser convention. Leading zeros
#'   are always stripped, following APA convention. Values below `1`
#'   raise an error; non-integer values are truncated (e.g. `3.7`
#'   becomes `3`).
#' @param decimal_mark Character used as decimal separator. Either `"."`
#'   (default) or `","`.
#' @param align Horizontal alignment of numeric columns in the printed
#'   ASCII table and in the `tinytable`, `gt`, `flextable`, `word`, and
#'   `clipboard` outputs. The first column (`Variable`) is always
#'   left-aligned. One of:
#'   - `"decimal"` (default): align numeric columns on the decimal
#'     mark, the standard scientific-publication convention used by
#'     SPSS, SAS, and LaTeX `siunitx`. Numeric cells are pre-padded
#'     with figure-spaces (U+2007, digit-width) so every string in a
#'     column has the same width with the decimal mark at the same
#'     internal position; centring those uniform-width strings then
#'     stacks the decimal points vertically. The same pad-then-centre
#'     strategy is applied on every rendering engine (`gt`,
#'     `tinytable`, `flextable`, `word`, ASCII print) for a
#'     homogeneous rendering, matching `table_regression()`. The
#'     `clipboard` output is delimited text meant to be parsed rather
#'     than read at a fixed width, so its cells travel unpadded (a
#'     padded number pastes as text next to an unpadded number).
#'   - `"center"`: center-align all numeric columns.
#'   - `"right"`: right-align all numeric columns.
#'
#'   The `excel` output uses the engine's default alignment in any
#'   case: cell-string padding does not align decimals under
#'   proportional fonts, and writing raw numbers with a numeric
#'   format would require a separate refactor.
#' @param output Output format. One of:
#'   - `"default"`: an ASCII table object, printed when the call is bare
#'   - `"data.frame"`: a plain wide `data.frame`
#'   - `"long"`: a raw long `data.frame`
#'   - `"tinytable"` (requires `tinytable`)
#'   - `"gt"` (requires `gt`)
#'   - `"flextable"` (requires `flextable`)
#'   - `"excel"` (requires `openxlsx2`)
#'   - `"clipboard"` (requires `clipr`)
#'   - `"word"` (requires `flextable` and `officer`)
#' @param excel_path File path for `output = "excel"`.
#' @param excel_sheet Sheet name for `output = "excel"`. `NULL` (the
#'   default) uses `"Linear models"`.
#' @param clipboard_delim Delimiter for `output = "clipboard"` (default:
#'   `"\t"`). A cell holding the delimiter itself, a double quote or a
#'   line break is quoted RFC 4180-style, so the grid survives whatever
#'   delimiter you choose.
#' @param word_path File path for `output = "word"`.
#' @param verbose Logical. If `TRUE`, prints messages about ignored
#'   non-numeric selected outcomes (default: `FALSE`).
#' @param user_na Logical. If `TRUE` (the default), declared missing
#'   values in the outcomes, in `by`, and in `covariates` are treated
#'   as missing and excluded from the fitted models (reflected in the
#'   per-group `n`). If `FALSE`, the declared codes enter the fits as
#'   ordinary values. See the "Declared missing values" section of
#'   [freq()].

#' @param style A journal style: a theme name (`"jama"`, `"nejm"`,

#'
#' The Excel sheet carries the same title the console prints on its
#' first row; the table itself starts on row 3, and the note lines sit
#' below the body.
#'
#' If no numeric outcome columns remain after applying `select`, `exclude`,
#' and `regex`, the function emits a warning and returns an empty
#' `data.frame()` regardless of `output`.
#'
#' @details
#' # Model and outputs
#'
#' `table_continuous_lm()` is designed for article-style reporting around
#' a single focal predictor: one model per selected continuous outcome,
#' fitted as `lm(outcome ~ by, ...)` and optionally extended with case
#' `weights` and additive `covariates` (`lm(outcome ~ by + cov1 + ...)`).
#' For categorical `by`, the reported means are model-based fitted means
#' (or covariate-adjusted estimated marginal means; see `adjustment`) for
#' each level, and contrasts come from the same fitted linear model. For
#' an unweighted `lm(y ~ factor)` with classical variance and no
#' covariates, the fitted means coincide numerically with empirical
#' subgroup means; the *model-based* qualifier matters because (a) under
#' `weights` the means become weighted least-squares estimates, (b) their
#' CIs derive from the model `vcov` (classical, `HC*`, `CR*`,
#' bootstrap or jackknife), (c) under `covariates` they become
#' adjusted marginal means, and (d) tests, *p*-values and effect sizes
#' all come from the same fitted model, keeping the table internally
#' consistent.
#'
#' Compared with [table_continuous()], this function is the model-based
#' companion: choose it when you want heteroskedasticity-consistent standard
#' errors (`vcov = "HC*"`), model fit statistics, or case weights via
#' `lm(..., weights = ...)`. Because the function exists to report a fitted
#' model, its inferential output is on by default: `p_value = TRUE` and
#' `r2 = "r2"` are the defaults; set `p_value = FALSE` or `r2 = "none"` to
#' suppress them.
#'
#' # Effect sizes
#'
#' Effect size is selected explicitly via `effect_size` (defaults to
#' `"none"`). All variants are derived from the same fitted model as the
#' displayed coefficients, `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}`, and CIs, so the effect size stays
#' internally consistent with the rest of the table.
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `"f2"`: Cohen's `\eqn{f^2}{f^2} = \eqn{R^2}{R^2} / (1 - \eqn{R^2}{R^2})` (Cohen 1988). Defined
#'     for any predictor type. For a single-predictor model, `\eqn{f^2}{f^2}` is a
#'     monotone transform of `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}` and adds no information beyond it; its
#'     primary use is in *a priori* power analysis (e.g. G*Power).
#'   \item `"d"`, `"g"`: standardized mean difference (Cohen's *d* or Hedges'
#'     *g*), defined only when `by` has exactly two non-empty levels.
#'     `d = beta_hat / sigma_hat` with `sigma_hat = summary(fit)$sigma` (the
#'     pooled within-group SD for the unweighted two-group case);
#'     `g = J * d` with `J = 1 - 3 / (4 * df_resid - 1)` (Hedges and Olkin
#'     1985). The sign matches the displayed `Delta (level2 - level1)`.
#'     For published reports of two-group comparisons, *g* is the
#'     convention recommended by Hedges and Olkin (1985).
#'   \item `"omega2"`: Hays' \eqn{\omega^2}, computed from weighted
#'     sums of squares as `(SS_effect - df_effect * MSE) / (SS_total
#'     + MSE)` and truncated at 0 for small or null effects (Hays
#'     1963; Olejnik and Algina 2003). Less biased than
#'     \eqn{\eta^2} (which equals `R^2` in this single-predictor
#'     design) and recommended for reporting variance explained in
#'     ANOVA-style designs (Olejnik and Algina 2003).
#' }
#'
#' All four effect sizes are point estimates derived from the OLS/WLS fit
#' and are **invariant to `vcov`**: choosing `HC*` changes the SE, CI, and
#' test statistic of the contrast but not the standardized magnitude
#' itself.
#'
#' **Under covariate adjustment** (`covariates` non-empty), `"f2"` and
#' `"omega2"` become the partial *\eqn{f^2}{f^2}* / partial *\eqn{\omega^2}{omega^2}* of `by`, derived
#' from the partial *F* restricted to the focal term (the Type-II
#' test of `by` after all covariates, equal to [stats::drop1()] in
#' this additive setting). `"d"` and `"g"` raise a `spicy_unsupported` error: the pooled
#' standard deviation has no canonical extension under adjustment, so
#' Cohen's *d* and Hedges' *g* are undefined for adjusted models. See
#' `effect_size` for the full dispatch.
#'
#' Confidence intervals for the effect size are available via
#' `effect_size_ci = TRUE` and use the modern noncentral-distribution
#' inversion approach, the consensus standard in commercial statistical
#' software (Stata `esize` / `estat esize`, SAS `PROC TTEST` and
#' `PROC GLM EFFECTSIZE` 14.2+) and in mainstream R packages
#' (`effectsize`, `MOTE`, `TOSTER`, `effsize`):
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `"d"`, `"g"`: noncentral *t* inversion (Steiger and Fouladi 1997;
#'     Goulet-Pelletier and Cousineau 2018). Empirical coverage is nominal
#'     across sample sizes (Fitts 2021), unlike the
#'     older Hedges-Olkin normal approximation which is biased for small
#'     samples. For Hedges' *g* the bounds inherit the *J* small-sample
#'     correction.
#'   \item `"omega2"`, `"f2"`: noncentral *F* inversion (Steiger 2004).
#'     Without covariates (model-level effect sizes), bounds are
#'     converted from the noncentrality parameter using
#'     `omega^2 = ncp / (ncp + N)` and `\eqn{f^2}{f^2} = ncp / N` respectively, with
#'     `N = df1 + df2 + 1` (total sample size). Under covariate
#'     adjustment (partial effect sizes), the bounds use the partial
#'     transforms instead: partial `\eqn{f^2}{f^2} = ncp / df2`, and for partial
#'     `omega^2` the inversion runs at the *F*-value equivalent of the
#'     omega-squared point estimate with bounds `ncp / (ncp + df2)` --
#'     the [effectsize::omega_squared()] `partial = TRUE` convention,
#'     which is narrower than the partial eta-squared CI because
#'     omega-squared shrinks the point estimate.
#' }
#' For the weighted case, the CI uses raw (unweighted) group counts and
#' `df.residual(fit) = n - p`, consistent with the WLS reporting convention
#' (DuMouchel and Duncan 1983). For propensity-score balance assessment or
#' complex-survey designs, dedicated packages ([cobalt::bal.tab()] for the
#' Austin and Stuart 2015 formulation; `survey` for design-based effect
#' sizes) are more appropriate.
#'
#' # Robust standard errors
#'
#' When `vcov` is one of the `HC*` variants, the standard errors, CIs, and
#' Wald test statistics use a heteroskedasticity-consistent sandwich
#' estimator computed via [sandwich::vcovHC()] (Zeileis 2004), the
#' canonical R implementation. For a brief guide:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `"HC0"` is the original White (1980) form; `"HC1"` adds the
#'     `n / (n - p)` correction (MacKinnon and White 1985), Stata's
#'     `, robust` default.
#'   \item `"HC2"` and `"HC3"` use leverage-based residual rescalings
#'     (MacKinnon and White 1985); `"HC3"` is the [sandwich::vcovHC()]
#'     default for small to moderate samples (Long and Ervin 2000).
#'   \item `"HC4"` adapts the leverage exponent for influential
#'     observations (Cribari-Neto 2004); `"HC4m"` is a modified-exponent
#'     refinement (Cribari-Neto and da Silva 2011); `"HC5"` is an
#'     alternative leverage-adaptive variant (Cribari-Neto, Souza and
#'     Vasconcellos 2007).
#' }
#'
#' When observations are not independent (repeated measurements per
#' individual, students nested in classes, patients in hospitals,
#' country-year panels), classical and `HC*` standard errors are biased
#' downward. Use the `CR*` variants together with `cluster = id_var` to
#' get cluster-robust inference (Liang and Zeger 1986). The
#' implementation dispatches to [clubSandwich::vcovCR()] for the
#' variance and to [clubSandwich::coef_test()] (single-coefficient,
#' Satterthwaite *t*) and [clubSandwich::Wald_test()] (multi-coefficient
#' Hotelling-T-squared with Satterthwaite df, "HTZ") for inference.
#' `"CR2"` (Bell and McCaffrey 2002; Pustejovsky and Tipton 2018) is the
#' modern recommended default; it generally produces fractional
#' Satterthwaite degrees of freedom in `df2`, which the displayed
#' `t(df)` / `F(df1, df2)` header renders to one decimal. `"CR1"`
#' applies the G/(G-1) correction only -- Stata's `, vce(cluster id)`
#' uses the larger G(N-1)/((G-1)(N-p)) factor with t(G-1) inference
#' (clubSandwich's `"CR1S"`; exposed for `lm` fits in
#' [table_regression()], not here), so `"CR1"` does not
#' reproduce Stata. Effect sizes remain invariant
#' to `vcov` (including `CR*`); only the SE, CI, test statistic, and
#' `df2` of the contrast change.
#'
#' Two resampling-based estimators are also available without adding
#' any dependency: `vcov = "bootstrap"` (nonparametric resampling-cases
#' bootstrap; Davison and Hinkley 1997) and `vcov = "jackknife"`
#' (leave-one-out delete-1; Quenouille 1956; MacKinnon and White 1985).
#' Supplying `cluster` switches both to their cluster-aware variants
#' (cluster bootstrap, Cameron, Gelbach and Miller 2008;
#' leave-one-cluster-out jackknife). The number of bootstrap replicates
#' is controlled by `boot_n` (default `1000`); replicates that fail to
#' fit on rank-deficient resamples are dropped, with an explicit warning
#' if more than half fail. Fewer than 10 valid bootstrap replicates (or
#' fewer than 2 jackknife leave-outs) raises `spicy_resampling_failed`
#' rather than silently reporting a different variance estimator.
#' Inference for both estimators is
#' asymptotic (`z` for single-coefficient contrasts, `chi^2(q)` for the
#' multi-coefficient global Wald test on `k > 2` categorical
#' predictors), reflected in the displayed test header. Use the
#' bootstrap when the residual distribution is non-standard or the
#' sample is small; use the jackknife as a closed-form, deterministic
#' alternative.
#'
#' `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}`, adjusted `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}`, and the effect sizes remain ordinary
#' least-squares (or weighted least-squares) statistics regardless of
#' `vcov`.
#'
#' # Weights
#'
#' When `weights` is supplied, `table_continuous_lm()` fits weighted
#' linear models via `lm(..., weights = ...)`. Means become weighted
#' least-squares estimates and contrasts and slopes are weighted. The
#' fit statistics `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}` and adjusted `\eqn{R^2}{R^2}`, as well as Hays' `omega^2`
#' and Cohen's `\eqn{f^2}{f^2}`, use the corresponding **weighted sums of squares**
#' from the WLS fit. Cohen's `d` and Hedges' `g` use the **WLS
#' coefficient and the model's weighted residual standard deviation**
#' (`summary(fit)$sigma`), which is the standard convention for
#' case-weighted regression-style reporting (DuMouchel and Duncan
#' 1983); the noncentral *t* CI for `d` / `g` uses the raw (unweighted)
#' group counts and the residual degrees of freedom of the WLS fit
#' (`n - p`). This case-weighted workflow is appropriate for weighted
#' article tables, but is **not** a substitute for a full complex-survey
#' design (see e.g. the `survey` package), nor for propensity-score
#' balance assessment under the Austin and Stuart (2015) convention
#' (see e.g. [cobalt::bal.tab()]).
#'
#' The `n` column always reports the unweighted analytic sample size for
#' each outcome. When `show_weighted_n = TRUE`, an additional
#' `Weighted n` column reports the sum of case weights in the same
#' analytic sample.
#'
#' # Display conventions
#'
#' For dichotomous categorical predictors, the wide outputs report fitted
#' means in reference-level order and label the contrast column
#' explicitly as `Delta (level2 - level1)`. For categorical predictors
#' with more than two levels, no single contrast or contrast CI is shown
#' in the wide outputs; instead, the table reports level-specific means
#' plus the overall `F` test when `statistic = TRUE` (or `F(df1, df2)`
#' when the degrees of freedom are constant across outcomes).
#'
#' When `covariates` is non-empty, the printed ASCII table appends an
#' APA-style footer naming the covariates and the chosen estimand, e.g.
#' `Note. Adjusted for age, education (proportional).`
#'
#' The rendering engines carry that same footer as a table note. On the
#' `"tinytable"` route the note is set one size down;
#' `options(spicy.note_style)` governs that (see [table_regression()]).
#'
#' Optional output engines require the corresponding suggested packages:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \pkg{tinytable} for `output = "tinytable"`
#'   \item \pkg{gt} for `output = "gt"`
#'   \item \pkg{flextable} for `output = "flextable"`
#'   \item \pkg{flextable} + \pkg{officer} for `output = "word"`
#'   \item \pkg{openxlsx2} for `output = "excel"`
#'   \item \pkg{clipr} for `output = "clipboard"`
