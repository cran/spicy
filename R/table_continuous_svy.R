# table_continuous_svy(): the design twin of table_continuous().
#
# Same table, same tokens, same six rendering engines, same typed view
# -- and not one statistic computed here. Every number comes from
# survey (Lumley): `svymean()` for the mean, its standard error and
# its design effect, `svyvar()` for the standard deviation,
# `svyquantile()` for the quantiles, `svyttest()` / `svyglm()` +
# `regTermTest()` / `svyranktest()` for the group comparison, and
# `degf()` for every degree of freedom that enters an interval or a
# test.
#
# What this file owns is the RESTITUTION: which columns the table
# shows, how a domain is cut, and the footer that says what design
# produced the numbers. The compute frame it builds has the schema
# `.continuous_compute_one()` produces, extended by `se` and `deff`,
# so `build_display_df()`, `export_desc_table()` and
# `.build_continuous_structured()` serve it unchanged.

# one that is right on a calibrated domain, where `[` retains the
# excluded rows at weight zero instead of dropping them.
#
# `!= 0`, NOT `> 0`. Linear calibration produces NEGATIVE weights --
# that is what `survey::calibrate(bounds = )` exists to prevent -- and
# a negative weight is a row the sampler drew and the calibration
# down-weighted, not a row to hide. On a linear-calibrated api design
# 28 of 183 rows go negative; `> 0` reported n = 155, a `Weighted n` of

# a `Max` of 789 for a sample whose maximum is 905.
#
# Each delegation is guarded on its own: a variable whose domain is too
# thin for a variance must not take the whole table down, and survey's
# own errors ("need at least two observations", a singular quantile
# interval) are exactly the degradations a `cell_undefined` dash is for.

#' Descriptive statistics from a survey design
#'
#' @description
#' The design twin of [table_continuous()]: the same table of means,
#' standard deviations, intervals and counts, computed from a
#' `survey::svydesign()` or `survey::as.svrepdesign()` object instead
#' of a data frame.
#'
#' Not one statistic is computed here. `survey::svymean()` gives the
#' mean, its standard error and its design effect, `survey::svyvar()`
#' the standard deviation, `survey::svyquantile()` the quantiles, and
#' `survey::svyttest()` / `survey::regTermTest()` /
#' `survey::svyranktest()` the group comparison. Every interval and
#' every test is referred to `survey::degf(design)`.
#'
#' @details
#' # Which function do I need?
#'
#' A data frame with a column of weights is [table_continuous()]
#' (`weights = `). A survey design object -- strata, clusters, finite
#' population correction, calibration, replicate weights -- is this
#' function. Passing one to the other errors with the name of the
#' right one; there is no silent coercion, because the design-based
#' standard errors, degrees of freedom and tests cannot be recovered
#' from the weights alone.
#'
#' # Two conventions, one bridge
#'
#' `table_continuous(weights = )` implements the **frequency-expansion**
#' convention: a weight is a number of copies, and `SD` has denominator
#' `sum(w) - 1`. This function implements the **sampling-weight**
#' convention: a weight is a number of units represented, and `SD` is
#' `sqrt(survey::svyvar())`, whose denominator is `n - 1` on weights
#' normalised to sum to `n`. These are two estimands, not two
#' approximations of one.
#'
#' `rescale = TRUE` is the bridge, and it is an identity rather than a
#' coincidence. Writing `w' = w * n / sum(w)`, the rescaled weighted
#' variance is
#' `sum(w' (x - xbar)^2) / (sum(w') - 1) = n / (n - 1) * sum(w (x - xbar)^2) / sum(w)`,
#' which is what `survey::svyvar()` computes. So on a design that
#' declares nothing but weights, `table_continuous(weights = w,
#' rescale = TRUE)` and this function return the same mean and the same
#' standard deviation. The default `rescale = FALSE` does not, and that
#' is the estimand boundary, not a bug.
#'
#' The mean is continuous across both regimes: `sum(w x) / sum(w)` does
#' not move when the weights are rescaled.
#'
#' # Choosing the statistics
#'
#' `show_columns` takes the tokens of [table_continuous()] with two
#' additions and one removal:
#'
#' * `"se"` -- the design-based standard error of the mean;
#' * `"deff"` -- the design effect (requires `deff = TRUE`);
#' * `"med_ci"` is refused. The exact interval of the sibling inverts a
#'   binomial sign test on independent observations, which a clustered
#'   or stratified sample is not.
#'
#' # Quantiles
#'
#' `qrule = "math"` is the default and estimates `inf{x : F(x) >= p}`,
#' the quantile of the *population*. `qrule = "spicy"` switches to the
#' type-7 interpolation `table_continuous()` uses, for a reader who
#' needs the two tables to agree cell for cell; any other value --
#' including a function -- is handed to `survey::svyquantile()`
#' untouched. The note always says which rule produced the numbers.
#'
#' # Groups and degrees of freedom
#'
#' `by = ` cuts one domain per group with `[` on the design. survey
#' recomputes the degrees of freedom on the primary sampling units and
#' strata each domain retains, so a grouped table generally carries a
#' *different* df per row; the note gives the span when they differ.
#'
#' A group with a missing value is a domain like any other:
#' `drop_na = FALSE` gives it a `(Missing)` row, with its own degrees
#' of freedom. A domain reduced to one primary sampling unit has none,
#' and its interval shows the undefined dash rather than an interval
#' built on `qt(p, df = 0)`.
#'
#' The comparison is a single test on the whole design, not a set of
#' pairwise ones: `survey::svyttest()` with two observed groups,
#' `survey::regTermTest()` on `survey::svyglm()` with three or more,
#' or `survey::svyranktest()` under `test = "nonparametric"`. Under a
#' design the Welch / Student distinction does not exist -- the
#' variance is the design's -- so `test = "student"` warns and behaves
#' like `"welch"`.
#'
#' # Stability
#'
#' This function is **stabilising** in the sense `?spicy` defines: the
#' names of its design-specific arguments may still be tightened
#' before 1.0 -- with a `NEWS.md` entry -- but the behaviour does not
#' change silently. It was experimental through 0.13; the shape of the
#' table has held across the cycle, so it now moves on the parent
#' family's clock rather than its own. The numbers themselves are
#' survey's and do not move with it.
#'
#' # What is absent, and why
#'
#' `weights` and `rescale` (the weighting *is* the design), `effect_size`
#' and `smd` (no established design-based variance), and `data`.
#'
#' @param design A survey design: `survey::svydesign()` or
#'   `survey::as.svrepdesign()`. Two-phase, pps, database-backed and
#'   multiframe designs are refused with a classed error.
#' @param select Columns to summarize, as a tidyselect expression on
#'   the design's variables.
#' @param by A single grouping column. One domain per level.
#' @param exclude Columns to drop from `select`.
#' @param regex Treat `select` as a regular expression.
#' @param drop_na Drop observations with a missing `by` value
#'   (default `TRUE`). With `FALSE` they form a `(Missing)` domain of
#'   their own -- an ordinary subpopulation, with its own degrees of
#'   freedom -- which is excluded from the group comparison.
#' @param deff Show the design effect: `FALSE` (default), `TRUE`
#'   (against sampling without replacement) or `"replace"` (against
#'   sampling with replacement, ignoring the finite population
#'   correction).
#' @param qrule Quantile rule: `"math"` (default), `"spicy"`, or
#'   anything `survey::svyquantile()` accepts, including a function.
#' @param df Degrees of freedom for the intervals. `NULL` (default)
#'   uses `survey::degf()` on each domain. It does not reach the group
#'   comparison: `survey::svyttest()` and `survey::svyranktest()` have
#'   no `df` argument, so the test keeps the design's own degrees of
#'   freedom and the note says so.
#' @param test Group comparison: `"welch"` (default), `"student"`
#'   (warns; identical under a design) or `"nonparametric"`. A
#'   variable whose complete cases include negatively weighted rows is
#'   not compared: a design-based test is not defined when the weights
#'   change sign. Its estimates are still reported, the note says which
#'   comparisons were withheld, and the call warns
#'   (`spicy_negative_weights_no_test`).
#' @param p_value Show the p-value column (defaults to `TRUE` with
#'   `by`).
#' @param statistic Show the test-statistic column.
#' @param show_n Show the count column.
