#' Describe one continuous outcome across several groupings
#'
#' @description
#' Summarises *one* continuous outcome across the levels of *several*
#' categorical variables, one block of rows per variable. It is the
#' inverse layout of [table_continuous()], which puts several outcomes
#' in rows and one grouping in columns.
#'
#' Each block reports the outcome's statistics level by level, plus its
#' own group comparison on the block's header row, and an `Overall` row
#' gives the marginal summary of the whole analytic sample.
#'
#' @details
#' # Which shape do I need?
#'
#' Several continuous variables across *one* grouping is
#' [table_continuous()] (`select = `, `by = `). One continuous variable
#' across one or several groupings is this function. A single `select` is
#' legitimate here -- it is the natural way in when you know more
#' groupings are coming -- but with several outcomes and one grouping,
#' the sibling is the table you want.
#'
#' # Choosing the statistics
#'
#' `show_columns` takes the same tokens as [table_continuous()], with
#' the same meanings; see the `show_columns` section of
#' `?table_continuous` for the vocabulary. Only the character-vector
#' form is accepted here: there is one outcome, so a per-variable list
#' would name nothing.
#'
#' # Weights
#'
#' `weights` applies the frequency-expansion convention of the family:
#' all weights 1 reproduces the unweighted table, and integer weights
#' reproduce the STATISTICS of the data duplicated that many times --
#' `n` stays the raw count of rows that carried the weights. Rows
#' with a missing or zero weight leave the analytic sample; the note
#' counts the missing ones.
#'
#' `rescale` is the switch between the two readings of a weight: the
#' frequency reading above, and the sampling-weight reading, where the
#' weights are normalised to sum to the sample size. See the Weights
#' section of [table_continuous()] for the choice in full.
#'
#' `rescale = TRUE` normalises the weights over the outcome's whole
#' surviving sample, once, never per level -- a per-level rescale
#' would destroy the relative weights across levels, which is the
#' entire information a sampling weight carries into this table. The
#' means are unchanged by it; the standard deviations move, because
#' their denominator is `sum(w) - 1`.
#'
#' A weighted table refuses the group comparison. The estimates and
#' their interval have no weighted version here, and a p-value or an
#' effect size silently computed unweighted beside weighted
#' descriptives is the one thing that must not happen: set `p_value =
#' FALSE` (and `statistic = FALSE`, `effect_size = "none"`), or use
#' [table_continuous_lm()] for a weighted comparison. The
#' order-statistic median interval is refused for the same reason.
#'
#' # Blocks and the group comparison
#'
#' Every block is a separate one-way comparison of the outcome across
#' the levels of that variable. Nothing in this table adjusts one block
#' for another, and the table note says so. Read the blocks as a set of
#' bivariate descriptions, not as a model.
#'
#' Each block chooses its test independently: with two observed levels
#' `test = "welch"` is the Welch t-test, with three or more it is the
#' Welch one-way ANOVA, and `test = "nonparametric"` is the
#' Wilcoxon rank-sum or the Kruskal-Wallis test on the same rule. A
#' block with fewer than two observed levels, or with a level holding a
#' single observation, is not tested; its statistics stay empty and the
#' other blocks are unaffected.
#'
#' # The `Overall` row
#'
#' `overall = TRUE` puts the marginal summary of the whole analytic
#' sample on the first row. Under the default `drop_na = FALSE` the
#' levels of every block partition that sample -- the `(Missing)`
#' display level included -- so each block's counts add up to the
#' `Overall` count exactly, which is what makes it a usable
#' denominator.
#'
#' The row reads **Overall**, not *Total*, and the distinction is
#' deliberate. *Total* is the word of a COUNT margin: the column of
#' [table_categorical()] where frequencies add up. This row is the
#' whole analytic sample, where a mean is recomputed over every
#' observation and nothing is added. A mean is not a total.
#'
#' # Choosing the `select` columns
#'
#' The canonical form is `select = where(is.factor)`, or an explicit
#' enumeration. Negation (`select = -c(x, y)`) is not recommended: it
#' sweeps in every remaining column, and a numeric one becomes a block
#' with one LEVEL per distinct value, in order of first appearance. A
#' variable producing more than 20 levels raises a warning for that
#' reason -- an arbitrary threshold, but a sixty-row block where a
#' reader expects a handful of categories is not a table.
#'
#' A `haven_labelled` column used as `select` shows its numeric CODES, not
#' its value labels, as it does in [table_continuous()]. Convert it
#' first (`haven::as_factor()`) to get the labels in the stub.
#'
#' # The table note
#'
#' One note sits under the table and states what left the analytic
#' sample, which group comparison ran in each block, what the displayed
#' columns mean, and how the blocks and the `Overall` row are to be
#' read. The rendering engines carry the same sentence as a table note.
#' On the `"tinytable"` route it is set one size down;
#' `options(spicy.note_style)` governs that (see [table_regression()]).
#'
#' @param data A data frame.
#' @param outcome The continuous outcome, unquoted or as a string.
#'   Exactly one column.
#' @param select The grouping characteristics to describe the outcome
#'   across, as a tidyselect expression or a character vector of column
#'   names. One block of rows per variable, in the order given. As
#'   everywhere in the family, `select` is what structures the rows.
#' @param labels Named character vector of display labels, for the
#'   outcome and for the `select` variables alike.
#' @param overall Show the marginal `Overall` row (default `TRUE`).
#' @param drop_na Drop rows with a missing `select` value from that block
#'   (default `FALSE`: they are shown as a `(Missing)` level and
#'   excluded from the comparison).
#' @param weights,rescale Frequency weights and whether to rescale them
#'   to sum to the sample size, as in [table_continuous()].
#' @param test Group comparison for every block: `"welch"` (default),
#'   `"student"` or `"nonparametric"`.
#' @param p_value Show the p-value column (default `TRUE`).
#' @param statistic Show the test statistic column.
#' @param show_n Show the count column.
#' @param show_columns Character vector of statistic tokens; `NULL`
#'   keeps the historical display.
#' @param effect_size,effect_size_ci Effect size per block and its
#'   confidence interval, as in [table_continuous()].
#' @param ci,ci_level The mean's confidence interval and its level.
#' @param digits,effect_size_digits,p_digits,decimal_mark Number
#'   formatting.
#' @param align Numeric-cell alignment: `"decimal"`, `"center"` or
#'   `"right"`.
#' @param output One of `"default"`, `"data.frame"`, `"long"`, or a
#'   rendering engine: `"tinytable"`, `"gt"`, `"flextable"`,
#'   `"excel"`, `"clipboard"`, `"word"`. `"data.frame"` and `"long"`
#'   are synonyms and return the same object: the compute frame is
#'   already long (one row per level, plus the block header and the
#'   overall row). Both names are kept so the argument reads the same
#'   here as in [table_continuous()], where the pair is also
#'   synonymous.
