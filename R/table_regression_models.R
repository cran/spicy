# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Supported-models registry for table_regression().
#
# ONE machine-readable source of truth (the registry data frame below) feeds:
#   * the exported accessor table_regression_models() (insight-style
#     supported_models() pattern -- the published list can never drift from
#     the code, unlike a hand-maintained Rd table);
#   * the capability table on its documentation page (rendered from the
#     registry at roxygen time via inline R);
#   * the pkgdown "Supported models" article.
#
# The documentation page doubles as the CONCEPT page for per-family
# behaviour: short sections per model family, reachable under the aliases
# table_regression_mixed / _ordinal / ... so `?table_regression_mixed` keeps
# working in the console while the reference index carries a single, genuine
# function entry.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The registry. One row per supported engine call. Kept internal; exposed
# through table_regression_models().

#' Supported models and per-family behaviour of table_regression()
#'
#' @description
#' `table_regression_models()` returns the registry of model classes
#' supported by [table_regression()], one row per engine, with each class's
#' family, average-marginal-effects estimand, `exponentiate` semantics, and
#' labelled table blocks. The same registry drives this page's table, so the
#' published list cannot drift from the code.
#'
#' This page is also the reference for **per-family behaviour** (the
#' sections below). It is reachable as `?table_regression_models`,
#' `?table_regression_mixed`, `?table_regression_ordinal`,
#' `?table_regression_counts`, `?table_regression_categorical`,
#' `?table_regression_survival`, `?table_regression_robust`, or
#' `?table_regression_bayesian`.
#'
#' If a class is not listed: fit the model and call `table_regression(fit)`
#' anyway -- unsupported classes error with a clear message naming the
#' supported set. Feature requests are welcome on the issue tracker.
#'
#' @section Supported classes:
#'
#' `r spicy:::.render_supported_models_md()`
#'
#' @section Shared semantics (all classes):
#' \itemize{
#'   \item A robust `vcov` request is honoured through the class's
#'     field-standard backend, or **refused with a clear error** naming the
#'     supported set; the footer always names the estimator actually
#'     applied.
#'   \item `exponentiate = TRUE` is link-gated: it produces a labelled ratio
#'     (OR / IRR / HR / RR / MR / TR) only where the link warrants
#'     one. Identity-link fits warn and are left untouched; non-ratio
#'     links (probit, cauchit, inverse, ...) are **refused with a clear
#'     error**.
#'   \item Class-specific structure renders as labelled subordinate blocks
#'     of rows in the same table, each explained by a footer line.
#'   \item Fit statistics default to the family's field standard
#'     (`show_fit_stats` overrides; class-inappropriate tokens are rejected
#'     with a pointer to the right ones).
#'   \item Everything is available programmatically: `broom::tidy()`,
#'     `glance()`, [as_structured()], `as.data.frame()`.
#' }
#'
#' @section Mixed effects:
#' Fixed effects: Satterthwaite t (`lmer` + \pkg{lmerTest}), Wald z
#' (`glmer`, `glmmTMB`), containment-df t (`lme`). Random effects render as
#' a `Random effects` block of rows (SD / correlation / residual with SE and
#' CI; `re_scale`, `re_columns`), deliberately with **no per-row p-value**
#' (boundary-invalid Wald; Self & Liang 1987) -- the footer carries the
#' chi-bar-squared LR test of the whole random part, and
#' `re_test = "lrt"` / `"rlrt"` adds an opt-in boundary-correct per-term
#' test. `N (groups)` and `ICC` are fit-stat rows; Nakagawa marginal /
#' conditional R-squared are the default R-squared family. `CR*`
#' cluster-robust standard errors are available for `lmer` and `lme` fits,
#' via \pkg{clubSandwich} with Satterthwaite degrees of freedom. `glmer`
#' and `glmmTMB` fits keep their model-based standard errors: a `CR*`
#' request on them is refused with a clear error.
#'
#' @section Population-averaged (GEE) models:
#' `geepack::geeglm()` fits are read on their own terms: the sandwich
#' standard errors the fit computed (its `std.err =` option, clustered
#' on its `id =`) are the displayed inference -- GEE is robust by
#' construction, so spicy's `vcov` / `cluster` arguments are refused
#' with a pointer to the fit options. Coefficients are
#' population-averaged (marginal) effects; the footer discloses the
#' working correlation structure with its estimated alpha. Wald z
#' inference; `exponentiate` follows the usual link gates (OR / IRR /
#' RR). Default fit statistics report the cluster structure (n,
#' `N (<id>)`, largest cluster); the quasi-likelihood information
#' criteria `"qic"` / `"qicu"` (Pan 2001) and the `"scale"`
#' (dispersion) parameter are opt-in -- there is no likelihood, so
#' AIC, pseudo-R-squared, `nested = TRUE`, and `standardized` are
#' refused. See the population-averaged section of the
#' [Mixed-effects regression tables](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/articles/table-regression-mixed.html)
#' article for the contrast with subject-specific mixed models.
#'
#' @section Ordinal models:
#' Cut-points render as a `Thresholds` block (log-odds scale, never
#' exponentiated; `show_thresholds`). Partial-proportional-odds `clm` terms
#' render as a `Non-proportional effects` block, one coefficient per
#' cut-point. `exponentiate` yields proportional odds ratios under logit;
#' `ci_method = "profile"` profiles the predictor coefficients. AME is
#' per-category (the marginal effect on each P(Y = k)). Defaults include
#' McFadden and Nagelkerke pseudo-R-squared. See the
#' [Ordinal regression tables](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/articles/table-regression-ordinal.html)
#' article.
#'
#' @section Counts and two-part models:
#' Two-part models show their full model: the zero component renders as a
#' `Zero-inflation` block (`zeroinfl`, glmmTMB `ziformula`: probability of a
#' structural zero) or a `Zero hurdle` block (`hurdle`: probability of a
#' nonzero count -- the opposite direction, hence the distinct label), and a
#' `Dispersion` block when `dispformula` has covariates. Component
#' coefficients join the `p_adjust` family and take stars; a zero component
#' is exponentiated only under a logit link (odds ratio). AME is the
#' combined-response effect on E(Y). `CR*` for `pscl` fits covers both components
#' via `sandwich::vcovCL()`. Opt out with `show_components = FALSE`.
#'
#' @section Categorical outcomes:
#' `multinom` renders per non-reference outcome; `exponentiate` yields
#' odds ratios of each outcome against the reference outcome -- the
#' baseline-category logits are log-odds (Agresti; SAS prints
#' "Odds Ratio Estimates" under its generalized-logit link; Stata's `mlogit, rrr` labels
#' the same quantity a relative-risk ratio). AME is per-outcome.
#' `nested = TRUE` compares nested `multinom` fits by likelihood-ratio test
#' (the `anova.multinom()` convention). Cluster-robust `CR*` is
#' available (one cluster value per observation; sandwich >= 3.1-2)
#' and the AME columns honour it; `HC*` is refused -- a multi-equation
#' model has no working residuals.
#' `mlogit` renders
#' per-alternative rows; AME is refused (no `slopes()` method exists for
#' its data format). `CR*` is available with one cluster value per choice
#' situation, and `n` counts choice situations; `HC*` is refused
#' (`sandwich::vcovHC()` mis-scales the meat for mlogit's per-chooser
#' score structure).
#'
#' @section Survival models:
#' Cox models exponentiate to hazard ratios; `survreg` log-scale
#' distributions to time ratios (identity-scale distributions are left
#' untouched). AME is refused for Cox fits (no marginal-probability effect
#' on the hazard scale); their absolute-effect columns are the
#' `"rmst"` and `"risk_diff"` families instead -- covariate-adjusted
#' RMST and cumulative-incidence differences by g-computation, with
#' the mandatory `tau` / `at_time` horizons. For `coxph`:
#' right-censored single-record fits, `strata()` supported
#' (within-stratum baselines), `tt()` refused. For `survreg`: the
#' closed-form AFT curves are standardized directly (stratified
#' `survreg` refused).
#' `CR*` uses the Lin-Wei grouped-dfbeta sandwich
#' (`coxph`) or `rms::robcov()` (`cph`, needs `x = TRUE, y = TRUE`).
#' `nested = TRUE` compares nested Cox fits by likelihood-ratio test.
#'
#' @section Survey-design models:
#' Fits from a `survey::svydesign()` or `survey::as.svrepdesign()`
#' design -- `svyglm` (and its replicate sibling `svrepglm`), `svyolr`,
#' `svycoxph` (and `svrepcoxph`) -- are read as design-based
#' throughout: the coefficients, the variance and the reference
#' distribution all come from survey.
#'
#' Inference is Wald **t** at the degrees of freedom survey writes on
#' the FIT -- `df.residual` for `svyglm` / `svyolr`, `degf.resid` or
#' `degf.residual` for the two Cox engines -- which is what
#' [survey::regTermTest()] takes as its denominator. It is not
#' `survey::degf(design)`, and it is not re-derived here: the six engines
#' of survey do not share one expression and are not harmonised (a Cox
#' fit carries `degf(design) - p + 1` although it has no intercept for
#' the `+ 1` to cancel, so it ends one above the two other classes). The
#' value is read off the object. The footer names the design and prints
#' the number, and the average marginal effects answer to the same
#' distribution as the coefficient rows.
#'
#' The average marginal effect is the Horvitz-Thompson estimator: the
#' mean unit-level effect weighted by the sampling weights of the
#' analytic sample, with its variance from the delta method on the
#' design vcov.
#'
#' Counts are both reported: the observed `n` and the `Weighted n` the
#' estimates describe. `svycoxph` adds the number of events, and its
#' concordance goes to the footer.
#'
#' What is refused, and why: every model-derived variance (`HC*`,
#' `CR*`, bootstrap, jackknife) -- the design is the variance
#' authority, and the way to change the estimator is to change the
#' design; every likelihood statistic (AIC, BIC, logLik, deviance,
#' pseudo-R-squared) for `svyolr` and `svycoxph` -- there is no
#' likelihood, and survey's own `deviance()` returns a sign-flipped
#' likelihood-ratio statistic on one Cox engine and a bare zero on the
#' other; the AME for `svycoxph`, on the same ground as for a plain Cox
#' fit; and the `"rmst"` / `"risk_diff"` columns for `svycoxph`, whose
#' uncertainty comes from resampling subjects and so ignores the strata
#' and clusters the design declares (use [survey::svykm()] for a
#' marginal curve).
#'
#' `nested = TRUE` is refused for a design-based table: there is no
#' likelihood to compare, so every change statistic would be empty, and
#' a block of empty rows reads like an answer. Put the models side by
#' side with `nested = FALSE`, and test a term under the design with
#' [survey::regTermTest()].
#'
#' `svyglm` keeps an `AIC` row: survey's `extractAIC.svyglm` computes
#' the design-based AIC of Lumley & Scott (2015), the one information
#' criterion published for this class, and
#' `show_fit_stats = "eff_p"` reports the effective number of design
#' parameters beside it. `BIC.svyglm` requires a maximal model and has
#' no default, so it stays blank. See the
#' [Summary tables from a survey design](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/articles/survey-tables.html)
#' article.
#'
#' @section Robust, IV, quantile and panel models:
#' `estimatr` fits keep their own robust SEs (never overwritten);
#' `quantreg::rq()` defaults to the heteroskedasticity-robust `"nid"`
#' sandwich (quantreg's own large-sample default), with `"iid"`,
#' `"ker"`, `"rank"` (CIs only) and a native `"bootstrap"` --
#' clustered via the wild gradient bootstrap -- as `vcov` options
#' (the footer names the estimator);
#' `fixest` fits -- and `estimatr` fits built with `fixed_effects =` --
#' disclose their absorbed fixed effects as a default-on
#' `Fixed effects:` block (one Yes / No row per factor;
#' varying-slope-only factors are not absorbed intercepts and read
#' No), with per-factor `N (<factor>)` counts via the opt-in
#' `n_groups` token and the within R-squared in the default fit
#' statistics for `fixest` (opt-in via `within_r2` for `estimatr`).
#'
#' @section Bayesian models:
#' Posterior median, posterior MAD SD, and equal-tailed credible
#' intervals (`ci_method = "hdi"` opts into the highest-density
#' interval); deliberately no p-value column and no stars -- the
#' probability of direction (`"pd"`) is the opt-in posterior summary.
#' A sampler-diagnostics guard checks every fit (R-hat, ESS,
#' divergences, E-BFMI) and per-coefficient `"rhat"` / `"ess_bulk"` /
#' `"ess_tail"` / `"mcse"` columns are available. The AME columns are
#' draws-native (posterior median, MAD SD and credible interval of
#' the per-draw `avg_slopes()`; no `"ame_p"`), and so are the
#' standardized betas (`"posthoc"` / `"basic"` / `"smart"`, exact
#' affine rescales of the draws) on fixed-effects fits:
#' `stan_glm`-style models and standard-formula `brm()` models,
#' whose design matrix is recovered through \pkg{insight}.
#' Multilevel fits, `stan_polr` / `stan_betareg`, brms formulas with
#' distributional or special terms, and `"refit"` / `"pseudo"` are
#' refused with a pre-standardization hint.
#' Multilevel fits
#' (`stan_glmer`, `brm` with grouping terms) report their random
#' effects as a block -- posterior median SD and credible interval per
#' component, from the draws -- with no likelihood-ratio line.
#' `p_adjust` and likelihood-based fit-statistic tokens are refused
#' (no p-values, no likelihood-based information criteria in a
#' posterior); `"r2_bayes"` is in the default fit statistics and
#' `"elpd_loo"` / `"looic"` / `"waic"` are opt-in, with standard
#' errors and reliability caveats in the footer; compare models with
#' `loo::loo_compare()` outside the table.
