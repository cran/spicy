# Class-generic variance-covariance + coefficient-inference backbone,
# reused by every model class via table_regression() (and by
# table_continuous_lm()). Moved here from R/lm_compute.R: nothing below is
# lm-specific. Contents:
#   * compute_model_vcov(): vcov family dispatch -- classical / HC* (sandwich) /
#     CR* (clubSandwich, sandwich::vcovCL, or the native Lin-Wei / robcov
#     path by class) / bootstrap / jackknife. The resamplers
#     (compute_resample_vcov_*) refit lm/glm and so apply only to those classes.
#   * compute_coef_inference(): single-coefficient inference; the reference
#     distribution (t vs z) follows the ESTIMATOR, not the fit class.
#   * compute_wald_test(): multi-coefficient Wald F / chi^2.
#   * compute_satt_df_per_coef(): clubSandwich Satterthwaite df map.

# Fits whose variance is fixed by a SAMPLING DESIGN, not by the working
# model: survey::svyglm() (Taylor linearisation), its replicate-weights
# sibling svrepglm, svyolr and svycoxph. For these the design carries the
# strata, the clusters, the finite population correction and any
# calibration, and stats::vcov(fit) already IS the (design-)robust
# variance. Every other estimator in the vcov vocabulary re-derives a
# variance from the working model and therefore ignores the design --
# silently and by orders of magnitude, in both directions (see the guard
# in compute_model_vcov()). The replicate-weight siblings and the two
# non-glm classes are listed explicitly rather than relying on
# inheritance so the predicate reads as the statement it is: this is
# executable documentation, and `svrepglm` / `svrepcoxph` were already
# caught through their parents.

# A robust estimator that could not be computed is an ERROR, never a
# silent substitution.
#
# Until 0.13 both robust branches warned and returned stats::vcov(fit) --
# the CLASSICAL matrix. Nothing downstream was told: `vcov_kind` is set
# from the REQUESTED type where the frame is built, `.robust_vcov_label()`
# formats that same requested type, and the footer therefore announced
# "heteroskedasticity-robust (HC3)" over classical standard errors. A
# warning in the console does not travel with a saved table, an exported
# Word document or a knitted report; the mislabelled numbers do.
#
# The register recorded the public paths as safe by construction, because
# the estimator is validated against the class first. They were not: the
# validator checks the estimator, not the CLUSTER, so
# `table_regression(fit, vcov = "CR2", cluster = <vector with NAs>)`
# rendered a full table of classical standard errors under a
# cluster-robust footer. Two of the tests migrated with this change were
# pinning exactly that, one of them through the public API.
#
# The honest-label alternative -- return the classical matrix and flip
# every downstream label to "classical" -- would have to thread a flag
# through the frame builders of every class; the truth cannot travel from
# here on its own. Refusing keeps the guarantee where it can be enforced:
