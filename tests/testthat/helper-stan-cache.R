# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Disk cache for the Stan fixtures.
#
# Every `.fit_brms_*` / `.fit_rstanarm_*` call compiles and samples a
# model, and test-regression_frame_stan.R alone calls them 22 times: the
# file takes about 19 minutes. Those fixtures are local-only
# (`.skip_unless_local_stan()`) exactly because that cost is nobody else's -- but a
# local run is also the ONLY place the brms half of the frame schema is
# ever exercised (AGENTS.md), so the cost lands on the one run that must
# not be skipped.
#
# A fit is therefore written to disk once and read back afterwards,
# keyed on everything that could make it stale: the R version, the
# fitting package's version, the fixture's name, and a hash of the
# fixture's own source. Change one character of the model call, the
# seed included, and the key changes with it. Nothing here is ever
# invalidated by hand.
#
# The cache lives under `dev/`, which exists only in a source checkout.
# `R CMD check` runs the tests from `<pkg>.Rcheck/tests/testthat`, where
# that directory is absent, so caching disables itself and the fixtures
# behave exactly as they did before -- no writing outside the session's
# own tree, nothing for a CRAN check to see. `dev/.fixture_cache/` is
# gitignored.
#
# That absence is also why the fixtures must never run on CRAN: with no
# cache, every one of them would compile and sample a Stan model on the
# check farm -- about half an hour here, and an ERROR wherever the Stan
# toolchain does not build. `skip_on_ci()` alone does not cover that: it
# reads the `CI` variable, which CRAN does not set, and brms / rstanarm
# are in Suggests, so CRAN installs them. Hence ONE guard, defined below,
# that skips both.

# Named, and defined once, so the two halves cannot drift apart.
