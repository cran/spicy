# Coverage-targeted tests for R/table_continuous.R.
#
# These exercise internal branches not reached by the existing
# table_continuous test suite:
#   * resolve_effect_size_choice(): the "none" short-circuit and the
#     four `explicit = FALSE` silent-fallback arms (parametric vs.
#     nonparametric measure / two- vs. multi-group mismatch). Through
#     the public API `effect_size` is only ever "auto" or "none" when
#     `explicit = FALSE`, so these fallbacks are only reachable by
#     calling the helper directly.
#   * compute_effect_size(): the `type = NULL` auto-resolution block and
#     the unknown-type abort.
#
# Each block makes a real assertion.
