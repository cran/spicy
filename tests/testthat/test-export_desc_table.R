#
# It used to read two facts off its caller -- a `has_group` flag and
# the raw compute frame it pulled the title from. Both are now
# arguments, because a family whose stub is one column and whose rows
# are indented blocks has neither.
#
# Pinned here, directly on the exporter rather than through a family:
#
#   * `stub_keys` drives all seven places the old flag reached,
#     including the three gt addresses by frozen NAME (the column
#     alignment, the numeric-column complement, the left spanner id);
#   * `indent_rows` is inert when empty and produces, per engine, the
#     indentation that engine can render;
#   * the title belongs to the caller, and its absence is refused.

#
# `tbl[["_spanners"]]` cannot answer the question at all.
# `desc_spanner_groups()` emits one group per COLUMN, so every column
# carries a one-wide `spn_<key>` spanner -- stub columns included, even
# when there is only one of them -- and the gt arm then puts the header
# text INTO the spanner and leaves the column label empty. The list
# therefore looks identical over a stub and over a value column; only
# `_styles` (locname == "columns_groups") records which spanners were
# aligned left. Every spanner also carries the top rule, so the list
# would not separate them on that either.
