# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# "Residual" is a reserved key of the variance-components frame.
#
# Every mixed engine writes the residual row as group = "Residual",
# term = "", and every consumer finds the residual by reading that
# string back: the nlme and glmmTMB SE / CI walks, the ICC kernel, the
# block sort, the footer panel, the null-model LR test. A grouping
# factor a user named `Residual` is therefore not merely confusable with
# the residual -- it is indistinguishable from it, and the frame carried
# the damage silently.
#
# Measured before the guard, on `lme(distance ~ age, random = ~ 1 |
# Residual)` over Orthodont: the group's variance row (4.47) came back
# with the residual's interval, [1.50, 2.79] -- an interval that does not
# contain its own estimate -- and the ICC went NA with nothing said.
#
# The frame refuses instead, at the constructor every engine passes
# through, because disambiguating means migrating five engines and seven
# readers onto an internal key: a contract change, not a guard.
