# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What a design table counts, and what it says about the design it was
# fitted under.
#
# Two changes that belong together:
#   * the default fit-statistic set. Design fits inherit "glm" (svyglm)
#     or "coxph" (svycoxph), so they were taking those classes' sets --
#     two pseudo-R-squareds and a Cox AIC, none of which exists without a
#     likelihood. The branches are independent PREDICATES that
#     concatenate, so a design branch placed "before" them removes
#     nothing: the design fits are EXCLUDED from any_glm / any_coxph, on
#     the is_bayes / is_gee idiom the file already uses.
#   * the footer. A regression under a design used to disclose neither
#     the sampling scheme nor the degrees of freedom its own t-tests use,
#     while the descriptive twin on the same design disclosed both.
