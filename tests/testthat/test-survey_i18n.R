# the English default -- it renders byte for byte like the key it
# should have used -- and only shows up the day a translation moves the
# key and leaves the literal behind.
#
# So the test moves them all: `spicy_str()` is mocked to return a
# marked string carrying the original's `sprintf` directives and
# nothing else. Anything English left in the rendered table is a
# literal, and the assertions name them one by one.
