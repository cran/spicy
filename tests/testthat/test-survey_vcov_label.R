# The footer names the variance estimator the DESIGN uses.
#
# The label was a literal, so a replicate-weight fit -- whose standard
# errors come from 15 or 104 refits and where no linearisation happens
# at all -- was footnoted "Design-based (Taylor linearisation)", while
# the descriptive twin on the SAME design said "replicate weights".
#
# The index is the variance mechanism, not the design's R class and not
# whether the twins support that design: a without-replacement pps
# design is linearised (ppsvar()) and unsupported there, so keying on
# support would have moved a correct label to a wrong one.
