# The tie convention of the absolute survival estimands.
#
# The rule, documented in ?table_regression and in
# vignette("table-regression-survival"): THE BASELINE HAZARD OF A
# SURVIVAL ESTIMAND FOLLOWS THE `ties` CONVENTION OF THE FIT IT WAS
# COMPUTED FROM. spicy does not fit, it reads a fit the user supplies,
# so it never overrides that choice -- .coxph_baseline() calls
# survival::basehaz(), which slaves ctype to fit$method.
#
# The rule is inherited rather than coded, which is exactly why it
# needs a witness: nothing in R/ would break if the baseline were
# reimplemented as a hand Breslow, or if ctype were forced. The
# fixture is therefore heavily TIED -- on a tie-free fixture Efron and
# Breslow coincide and every assertion below is vacuous (survival's
# aeqSurv()/timefix also fuses near-equal times, so "continuous times"
# is not a guarantee of tie-freedom: the tie count is asserted, not
# assumed).
#
# Efron is the better default, not the correct answer: the
# approximations are all biased at finite sample size and agree
# asymptotically, and Efron's virtue is a much smaller small-sample
# bias (Hertz-Picciotto & Rockhill 1997; Efron 1977).
