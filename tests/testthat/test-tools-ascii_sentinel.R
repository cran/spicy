# in a review they are ordinary spaces. The witness below therefore
# writes the offending character with `intToUtf8()` rather than as a
# literal, so this file cannot be read as "a space is a space" either.
# The same idiom carries the control-byte witnesses: a raw U+0001
# written into THIS file would be exactly the thing under test, and
# exactly as unreadable.

# tools/ is shipped in the tarball but not in the installed package, so
