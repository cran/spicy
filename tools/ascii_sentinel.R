# Byte sentinel for R/.
#
# The class this closes is the INVISIBLE one. Three U+00A0 NO-BREAK
# SPACEs got into R/ during the outcome campaign: they read as ordinary
# spaces in the editor, in the diff and in the review, and only a byte
# scan told them apart. A no-break space inside a string is a different
# string; inside code it is a parse error at a column nothing points at.
#
# So the rule is an ALLOWLIST, not a denylist: every non-ASCII
# codepoint that appears in R/ is named here with the reason it earns
# its place, and anything else is a hard failure. No member of the list
# is invisible, and that is the property worth keeping -- a character
# that has to be invisible belongs in the source as a `"\uXXXX"`
# escape, the way `intToUtf8(0x200B)` is already written elsewhere in
# the package.
#
# TWO rules, because the first one alone had a hole underneath it. The
# scan looked only ABOVE 0x7F, and the invisible characters do not all
# live up there: a raw U+0001 sat in `.cat_svy_block_id()` as the
# literal control byte -- correct at run time, unreadable in the source,
# and beneath the scan's floor in both directions (register n. 269).
# So a C0 CONTROL character is a hard failure too, with no allowlist at
# all: tab is the one that has a job in source text, and every other
# one belongs in the source as the same `"\uXXXX"` escape. The remedy
# is the escape, never the byte, and it costs nothing -- the string is
# identical once parsed.
#
# What the control rule does NOT cover is U+0000: `readLines()` drops
# it and the line's remainder with it. That is the one control byte R
# refuses to parse at all ("nul character not allowed"), so it can
# never ship quietly -- it fails loudly long before a byte scan, which
# is the opposite of the class this file exists for.
#
# The lists are keyed by codepoint rather than by the character, so
# this file stays pure ASCII and cannot fail its own rule.
#
# Sourced by tools/run_suite.R, which runs it before the suite: a
# 40-minute run is too long to spend finding this out at the end.

# codepoint -> what it is, and where it earns its place in R/
